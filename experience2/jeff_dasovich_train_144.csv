These estimates are for Enron budgetary purposes only, and do not represent a commitment or a ""not to exceed"" figure for Goodin, MacBride. The actual fees incurred may exceed these estimates, and GMSRD will bill Enron on a hourly fee basis, as opposed to the retainer mechanism used in the first part of this year. 1. Direct access legislation: This involves working on a continuing series of bills related to direct access. I cannot estimate a specific amount for the entire legislative project, it depends on how long it takes for the legislature to enact significant direct access legislation. My best estimate is $8,000 per month, or $24,000 over three months. The estimate would increase if direct access is still at issue in the session's last month--August. As of May 11, 2001, we have recorded approximately $3000 in billings related to direct access in this month. 2. Improved powerplant siting and increased emission offset legislation: $15,000 over three months, more if the final legislative solution is delayed until August. We have recorded approximately $1,000 in billings related to this area this month (through May 11, 2001). 3. Windfall profits tax bill: This project required additional upfront legal research regarding the constitutionality of the proposed tax. We have billed legal fees for approximately $4000 in May, 2001, up through May 11. My best estimate is $18,000 over three months of session, more if the bill is still alive in August. 4. Global settlement/Edison MOU/Plan B legislation: This project covers the gamut of comprehensive legislative proposals to address the energy crisis, including a proposal by the Governor, legislation to approve the Edison MOU or an alternative plan which does not involve purchase of the Edison transmission system, commonly referred to as ""Plan B"". As explained by Paul Kaufman, this work is expected to involve less work in the near term, and more as the legislation actually moved forward in the future. Trying to average this increasing level of work over time is difficult, but I am estimating $15,000 over the next three months, more if the package is still being enacted in August. We have recorded approximately $2000 in billings on this issue through May 11, 2001 this month. Please contact me if you have any questions regarding any of the above.

We are trying to get folks who are dealing with the nuts and bolts issues, someone on the ground -- you get the idea - someone from Houston. Below are the details on the panel: Tuesday November 14th -- 1:30 p.m. - 3:00 p.m. Natural Gas Issues Issue: The future cost and availability of natural gas will become a dominant factor in the generation of electricity in California as more generation is built in future years. We have seen the natural gas price increase over 100% in the last fifteen months. Why has the price increased so dramatically? While the price increases can be expected to spur increased exploration and drilling, and this supply. Where can California expect to procure its natural gas supply and at what price over the next five to ten years? There are now some significant natural gas storage facilities coming on line - will they help hedge future price volatility? Are independent, unregulated generators concerned about our natural gas future? Who are the largest competitors to California for natural gas supply and what will be the role of new technology in increasing capture of new supply? Moderator: Keith McCrea Suggested Panelists: ____________, California Energy Commission (Fuels planner) ____________, El Paso Energy Corporation (Pipeline representative) ____________, Fuels Procurement, Calpine ____________, Enron ____________, Gas Storage Representative Ed Yates, CA League of Food Processors (customer perspective) Can you get back to me and let me know if and who could participate from Enron?

We are trying to get folks who are dealing with the nuts and bolts issues, someone on the ground -- you get the idea - someone from Houston. Below are the details on the panel: Tuesday November 14th -- 1:30 p.m. - 3:00 p.m. Natural Gas Issues Issue: The future cost and availability of natural gas will become a dominant factor in the generation of electricity in California as more generation is built in future years. We have seen the natural gas price increase over 100% in the last fifteen months. Why has the price increased so dramatically? While the price increases can be expected to spur increased exploration and drilling, and this supply. Where can California expect to procure its natural gas supply and at what price over the next five to ten years? There are now some significant natural gas storage facilities coming on line - will they help hedge future price volatility? Are independent, unregulated generators concerned about our natural gas future? Who are the largest competitors to California for natural gas supply and what will be the role of new technology in increasing capture of new supply? Moderator: Keith McCrea Suggested Panelists: ____________, California Energy Commission (Fuels planner) ____________, El Paso Energy Corporation (Pipeline representative) ____________, Fuels Procurement, Calpine ____________, Enron ____________, Gas Storage Representative Ed Yates, CA League of Food Processors (customer perspective) Can you get back to me and let me know if and who could participate from Enron? Thanks for your help. Delaney P.S. You better be planning to attend this year -- at least the day sessions! :-)"

We met with Edison yesterday in the attempt to settle our negative CTC claim. ? Edison continues to take a very hard-line, extreme position. This is it in a nutshell: 1. all customers--bundled and DA alike--""contributed to Edison's undercollection"" and all customers must pay it down; 2. bundled customers contributed through frozen rates and DA customers contributed through the negative CTC; 3. Edison says it will pay ESPs past due amounts related to the negative CTC, but it intends to then turn around and assess a charge on all customer bills--DA and bundled alike--to recover its undercollection. 4. Edison intends to collect it over approximately 2 years. Edison estimates that the charge to DA customers over this period would be about $25-27/MWH. 5. Under Edison's plan, Enron would likely end up paying Edison, i.e., the present value of the ""undercollection"" charge would exceed the present value of the lump sum negative CTC payment. ? Obviously, with respect to any settlement with Edison, we're extremely far apart and we're therefore considering other options. ?

It would be an understatement to say that the last year's worth events have been amazing at best. As we discussed at lunch, Enron has developed a unique approach to QF contract restructuring. The main premise is that of conducting a dual auction to determine, on a completely voluntary and open process, the QF buyout economics and the market clearing price for replacement energy. As discussed yesterday, I am enclosing copies of the presentations made to PG&E and SCE on this topic. I would be very interested in your feedback on this concept and on the presentations provided. I must footnote that the economic shown in the presentations are Enron estimates. Individual feedback, particularly in this area would be appreciated. Jeff Dasovitch out of our SF office has been working with me on this proposal and will likely be contacting you within the next day to further discuss this idea as well as the benefits and possible strategies for initiating such an auction process.

Jeff Dasovitch out of our SF office has been working with me on this proposal and will likely be contacting you within the next day to further discuss this idea as well as the benefits and possible strategies for initiating such an auction process. Thanks for your time and look forward to hearing from you.

The electric service providers and customers who are parties shall w= ork with other parties and shall jointly submit a proposed protective order= and nondisclosure agreement that will cover parties other than Commission = staff by December 11, 2001. 4. Parties' supplemental comments to the comments they filed in respons= e to the October 23rd Assigned Commissioner Ruling shall be submitted by Ja= nuary 4, 2002. As a preliminary matter, of course, AReM and WPTF do not, in their own name= s, have direct access contracts.

	smara@enron.com, jdasovic@enron.com","Good draft. Few comments: * As much as we may not like it, the commission is where the action is right now, and we're going to have to work with them. As such, I think the comments would be significantly more effective if you go through the document and edit out the invective and other highly charged adjectives, which, while therapeutic, tend to incent the Commission to ignore or be even more hostile to our interests. In short, I don't see an upside to it and there is downside. Rather than try to edit, I've simply compiled those paragraphs that in my view should be deleted or require serious toning-down. In addition to these specific areas, I would recommend going through the document and toning it down generally. * Seems that it would be useful, up front and at the end, to give OUR answer (maybe I'm repeating Jim's comments here): e.g., The Commission should 1) not do retroactive, 2) permit customers to do what the contracts permit (e.g., add facilities, renew, etc.), 3) hold hearings on all of Wood's unsubstantiated assertions, and 4) anything else we want to be part of the solution as it relates to the issues raised by Karl. * On page 2, do we run the risk of affirming what Angelides and others are saying, i.e., that DA could bankrupt the state? Sure we need to say it, since it seems to play into their spin and everyone already knows of the bind they're in? Could backfire. * Point # 6 on page 14: are we inviting the Commission to ask parties to submit contracts? Possible to re-write or eliminate this so that it doesn't appear we're advocating having folks submit them? Good job. Thanks for your efforts.

Until the next legislative session starts up, the call will be optional for the gang in Sacramento. If you have any alternative suggestions, questions, and/or comments, please let me know. And please forward to others who need/would like to know. Best, Jeff"

After reviewing your presentation, here are some tough questions that we can discuss tomorrow: 1. Would the replacement energy from the market be obtained under contracts of similar length and firmness as the QF contracts that the energy replaces? If not, why would the CPUC want to replace long-term, committed QF power with short-term firm energy? WOULDN'T HAVE TO, BUT PRESUMABLY THE REPLACEMENT POWER WOULD BE CONSIDERABLY MORE ""DISPATCHABLE."" 2. Why would the CPUC want to replace long-term QF power over which it has substantial regulatory leverage (through SRAC pricing) with market energy from sources over which it may have less control? PRICES WOULD BE FIRM AND WOULD REDUCE POWER COSTS TO CONSUMERS SUBSTANTIALLY AND AVOID THE PROTRACTED, COSTLY LITIGATION THAT GOES ON INCESSANTLY BETWEEN EDISON AND QFS. (AND WOULD AVOID ALMOST LOSING THE QFS BASED ON CONTINUED NEGATIVE ACTIONS BY EDISON.) IN SHORT, ENDING THE HOLY WARS IS A GOOD THING. 3. Are there 8,000 MWs of low-cost replacement energy available in California, or in the WSCC with firm transmission to California? How steep is the supply curve for replacement energy? FORECASTS SHOW ONE HELLUVALOT OF POWER COMING ON LINE. HOWEVER, IF THERE WERE CONCERNS, THE MWS COULD BE CAPPED. 4. After a QF is bought out, I assume that it would simply operate in the electric market as a merchant plant, if it continues to operate to provide on-site power and thermal energy. Is this correct? YES. 5. How sensitive are your calculated ratepayer and QF benefits to changes in the relationship between SRAC (i.e. gas) and electric market prices? OBVIOUSLY, VERY CONNECTED. 6. Assuming that there are both ratepayer and QF benefits from QF contract buyouts, why is there a need for a formalized auction process, when the same benefits might be captured through bilateral negotiations (such as the QF buyouts done to date)? BILATERAL NEGOTIATIONS DO NOT EXIST. THEY ARE A MYTH. THIS TRIES TO GET AROUND THAT IMPASSE. 7. Doesn't your proposal require the utilities to be back in the power procurement business? If not, why not? THAT'S A GOOD THING. AND NO MORE THAN THEY WOULD BE OVER THE LIFE OF THE QF CONTRACTS. As you perhaps can tell, my questions focus on whether now is the right time for such a broad plan to buyout QF contracts. THERE ARE ALWAYS REASONS TO CONCLUDE THAT NOW IS NOT THE RIGHT TIME. ON THE OTHER HAND, THERE'S NO TIME LIKE THE PRESENT. AND IF A QF HAS THE OPTION OF 1) RECEIVING THE NPV OF THE QF AND 2) RETAINING CONTROL OF THE ASSET, I'VE STRUGGLED MIGHTILY TRYING TO FIND A DOWNSIDE FOR THE QF. LOOK FORWARD TO TALKING TOMORROW.

I ran across Perfect when I was doing an MBA project--we were required to find a company that we could consult to on e-commerce strategy. I've since found out that Perfect's doing a pilot with EES--acting as the e-procurment platform for products tied to EES' outsourcing deals. From what I hear it's going well, and EES is enthusiastic. The technology is very interesting: soup to nuts e-procurement platform developed by Paul Milgrom (global auction guru and economist at Stanford). Glad you guys can meet with them.

Congratulations on your new role. Sounds exciting (in addition to exhausting). Based on our call, I contacted Perfect Commerce. The two folks from their shop that will be in Houston are: Ian Sullivan SVP, Professional Services and all implementation of the product Cameron Sellers VP, Business Development They'd like to meet sometime during the week of October 15th. Let me know if that works for you and Brad. Or if you'd like to contact them directly, just let me know and I'll get you their numbers/emails. I ran across Perfect when I was doing an MBA project--we were required to find a company that we could consult to on e-commerce strategy. I've since found out that Perfect's doing a pilot with EES--acting as the e-procurment platform for products tied to EES' outsourcing deals. From what I hear it's going well, and EES is enthusiastic. The technology is very interesting: soup to nuts e-procurement platform developed by Paul Milgrom (global auction guru and economist at Stanford). Glad you guys can meet with them. I think it's definitely worth the time--the technology may fit very well with Networks.

(PR) Subject: Colorful Dissent from Two PUC Commissioners Opposed to Suspending DA Commissioners Henry M. Duque and Richard A. Bilas, dissenting: One could say that this order is consistent with the Administration's present third world country mentality. We are punishing the very consumers and providers who made a commitment to ensuring electric restructuring did work by adding a demand retail component to cure the dysfunctions in the wholesale market. We are not convinced that the Department of Water Resources (DWR) bond ratings depend on killing direct access. This notion is a scare tactic and a smoke screen. Direct access comprises such a small percentage of overall demand that it cannot reasonably be seen to be a threat to the sale of the bonds. Direct Access should be seen as a benefit to DWR. It would decrease the amount of the utilities net short obligations and relieve DWR from its power purchasing responsibilities sooner. Something else is going on here. We think that the DWR does not want direct access because if the public is presented with alternatives, it will make DWR's purchasing mistakes abundantly clear. The Commission should be holding hearings to test the assertions being made by DWR, Finance and the Treasurer. Instead, the Commission is making an ill informed, panicked decision to act now and study the repercussions later. DWR and the bonds should not be threatened by direct access if DWR is making prudent energy purchases. Only if DWR's contracts are too expensive, relative to market, will customers seek shelter in lower direct access prices. Indeed, retaining direct access as a way to send price signals to consumers may be the only way to place pressure on DWR to make more prudent purchases. This is a very important consideration since AB 1X prevents us from engaging in any prudency review of the DWR costs to be passed through to ratepayers in order to repay the bonds. If there is no yardstick, how can anyone measure DWR performance? The answer is, one can't, unless SB 18xx is signed into law. We think that additional review of these issues, before suspending direct access, would have produced a more sound decision in the long run. For these reasons we must respectfully dissent. /s/ HENRY M. DUQUE /s/ RICHARD A. BILAS Henry M. Duque Richard A. Bilas Commissioner Commissioner September 20, 2001",3285,"Will do.

Present were Don Sevrens, news editor/insight section; Bill Osborne, senior editor/opinion; Jim Gogek, editorial writer; Bernie Jones, editor, opinion pages; Craig Rose, the reporter who has written extensively on the topic, and a photographer. My two primary messages were that (1) wholesale and retail competition is working elsewhere, particularly in Pennsylvania, and can eventually work in California if the rules are changed, and (2) California has a severe supply shortage and needs to focus on providing incentives for new generation and expediting the permitting process. I was subtly trying to get across the message that leadership was needed to help Californians deal with the need to reconcile their environmental and land use goals with the need to bring their power supply and demand into balance. I, of course, defended FERC's order on the causes of the price volatility in California this summer and their lack of any authority to order retroactive refunds. I also pointed out that there were no findings of individual market abuse, so that refunds wouldn't be warranted even if there was legal authority. I also pointed out the problems with price caps. Other than Craig Rose, who disagreed with me any chance he got, the others asked good questions and seemed to be listening. They made the point repeatedly that this matter is very political, suggesting that a political compromise with the generators/marketers is necessary. One of them said he had heard there was a deal with the generators being negotiated and asked me my position. I responded that I had no response.

Present were Don Sevrens, news editor/insight section; Bill Osborne, senior editor/opinion; Jim Gogek, editorial writer; Bernie Jones, editor, opinion pages; Craig Rose, the reporter who has written extensively on the topic, and a photographer. My two primary messages were that (1) wholesale and retail competition is working elsewhere, particularly in Pennsylvania, and can eventually work in California if the rules are changed, and (2) California has a severe supply shortage and needs to focus on providing incentives for new generation and expediting the permitting process. I was subtly trying to get across the message that leadership was needed to help Californians deal with the need to reconcile their environmental and land use goals with the need to bring their power supply and demand into balance. I, of course, defended FERC's order on the causes of the price volatility in California this summer and their lack of any authority to order retroactive refunds. I also pointed out that there were no findings of individual market abuse, so that refunds wouldn't be warranted even if there was legal authority. I also pointed out the problems with price caps. Other than Craig Rose, who disagreed with me any chance he got, the others asked good questions and seemed to be listening. They made the point repeatedly that this matter is very political, suggesting that a political compromise with the generators/marketers is necessary. One of them said he had heard there was a deal with the generators being negotiated and asked me my position. I responded that I had no response.

This would result in a pretty small percentage. Another way to look at it would be on a % of load basis. If you use the DA load information Sue forwarded to us on October 1st, this % (5.7%) would also be very small. How do you think they will look at it?

Fielder wanted to talk about the negative CTC issue. Here's what he said: They plan to ""settle"" with the ESPs and pay them when they pay everyone else, which he re-iterated would be sometime in Q1'02. Edison is holding firm to the notion that the negative CTC contributed to the utility's undercollection and that the ESP's share of the undercollection has to be netted against the payables attributable to the negative CTC and owed the ESP. He said that they will propose to net it out in one of two ways: 1) lump sum netting (i.e., if they owe $50MM and the share of the undercollection is $30 MM, then they pay the ESP $20 MM; or 2) future reductions in PX Credit (i.e., they pay the ESP $50 MM, and then reduce the PX going forward until the $30 MM is paid down). The numbers are illustrative only. In addition, he said that they have the view that a decision is going to have to be made about 1) whether DA customers pay for stranded costs tied to the DWR L-T contracts, and 2) whether DA customers pay going forward for stranded costs tied to the QF contracts.

Best, Jeff",4684,"Need to think about it a bit. Here's some of what we know based on the settlement: Total debt = 6.35 B After they contribute all cash on their books and agree to eat a little, the PUC is allowing them to collect somewhere between $3.0-3.3B--depends on who you talk to. The total owed to ESPs is $243 MM.","-----Original Message----- From: Curry, Wanda Sent: Tuesday, October 23, 2001 5:56 PM To: Dasovich, Jeff Cc: Steffes, James D.; Tribolet, Michael Subject: RE: Conversation with Edison re: Getting Negative CTC Paid Jeff, Do we know how much Edison's total under collection is? Would it be as simple as to determine their total (around $3 billion?) and gross receivable (before any payments - 145 million) and calculate the % (around 5%)? This would result in a pretty small percentage. Another way to look at it would be on a % of load basis. If you use the DA load information Sue forwarded to us on October 1st, this % (5.7%) would also be very small. How do you think they will look at it? I think we would all agree to a 5% haircut, if they would JUST PAY US!

I'm sure that's how Edison would calculate it. Does it make sense to run the numbers and see what our ""contribution"" to Edison's undercollection would be under Edison's view? If you need another copy, let me know. Question: I don't know what our book looks like on this issue, but if we were to take the ""netting"" through a reduction in the PX credit going forward, how much of a hit would that be, particularly if we were to get the $120 MM up front?

Fielder wanted to talk about the negative CTC issue. Here's what he said: They plan to ""settle"" with the ESPs and pay them when they pay everyone else, which he re-iterated would be sometime in Q1'02. Edison is holding firm to the notion that the negative CTC contributed to the utility's undercollection and that the ESP's share of the undercollection has to be netted against the payables attributable to the negative CTC and owed the ESP. He said that they will propose to net it out in one of two ways: 1) lump sum netting (i.e., if they owe $50MM and the share of the undercollection is $30 MM, then they pay the ESP $20 MM; or 2) future reductions in PX Credit (i.e., they pay the ESP $50 MM, and then reduce the PX going forward until the $30 MM is paid down). The numbers are illustrative only. In addition, he said that they have the view that a decision is going to have to be made about 1) whether DA customers pay for stranded costs tied to the DWR L-T contracts, and 2) whether DA customers pay going forward for stranded costs tied to the QF contracts. (Edison is clearly lobbying the PUC to get DA customers to pay for these costs.)
