These estimates are for Enron budgetary purposes only, and do not represent a commitment or a ""not to exceed"" figure for Goodin, MacBride. The actual fees incurred may exceed these estimates, and GMSRD will bill Enron on a hourly fee basis, as opposed to the retainer mechanism used in the first part of this year. 1. Direct access legislation: This involves working on a continuing series of bills related to direct access. I cannot estimate a specific amount for the entire legislative project, it depends on how long it takes for the legislature to enact significant direct access legislation. My best estimate is $8,000 per month, or $24,000 over three months. The estimate would increase if direct access is still at issue in the session's last month--August. As of May 11, 2001, we have recorded approximately $3000 in billings related to direct access in this month. 2. Improved powerplant siting and increased emission offset legislation: $15,000 over three months, more if the final legislative solution is delayed until August. We have recorded approximately $1,000 in billings related to this area this month (through May 11, 2001). 3. Windfall profits tax bill: This project required additional upfront legal research regarding the constitutionality of the proposed tax. We have billed legal fees for approximately $4000 in May, 2001, up through May 11. My best estimate is $18,000 over three months of session, more if the bill is still alive in August. 4. Global settlement/Edison MOU/Plan B legislation: This project covers the gamut of comprehensive legislative proposals to address the energy crisis, including a proposal by the Governor, legislation to approve the Edison MOU or an alternative plan which does not involve purchase of the Edison transmission system, commonly referred to as ""Plan B"". As explained by Paul Kaufman, this work is expected to involve less work in the near term, and more as the legislation actually moved forward in the future. Trying to average this increasing level of work over time is difficult, but I am estimating $15,000 over the next three months, more if the package is still being enacted in August. We have recorded approximately $2000 in billings on this issue through May 11, 2001 this month. Please contact me if you have any questions regarding any of the above.

We are trying to get folks who are dealing with the nuts and bolts issues, someone on the ground -- you get the idea - someone from Houston. Below are the details on the panel: Tuesday November 14th -- 1:30 p.m. - 3:00 p.m. Natural Gas Issues Issue: The future cost and availability of natural gas will become a dominant factor in the generation of electricity in California as more generation is built in future years. We have seen the natural gas price increase over 100% in the last fifteen months. Why has the price increased so dramatically? While the price increases can be expected to spur increased exploration and drilling, and this supply. Where can California expect to procure its natural gas supply and at what price over the next five to ten years? There are now some significant natural gas storage facilities coming on line - will they help hedge future price volatility? Are independent, unregulated generators concerned about our natural gas future? Who are the largest competitors to California for natural gas supply and what will be the role of new technology in increasing capture of new supply? Moderator: Keith McCrea Suggested Panelists: ____________, California Energy Commission (Fuels planner) ____________, El Paso Energy Corporation (Pipeline representative) ____________, Fuels Procurement, Calpine ____________, Enron ____________, Gas Storage Representative Ed Yates, CA League of Food Processors (customer perspective) Can you get back to me and let me know if and who could participate from Enron?

We are trying to get folks who are dealing with the nuts and bolts issues, someone on the ground -- you get the idea - someone from Houston. Below are the details on the panel: Tuesday November 14th -- 1:30 p.m. - 3:00 p.m. Natural Gas Issues Issue: The future cost and availability of natural gas will become a dominant factor in the generation of electricity in California as more generation is built in future years. We have seen the natural gas price increase over 100% in the last fifteen months. Why has the price increased so dramatically? While the price increases can be expected to spur increased exploration and drilling, and this supply. Where can California expect to procure its natural gas supply and at what price over the next five to ten years? There are now some significant natural gas storage facilities coming on line - will they help hedge future price volatility? Are independent, unregulated generators concerned about our natural gas future? Who are the largest competitors to California for natural gas supply and what will be the role of new technology in increasing capture of new supply? Moderator: Keith McCrea Suggested Panelists: ____________, California Energy Commission (Fuels planner) ____________, El Paso Energy Corporation (Pipeline representative) ____________, Fuels Procurement, Calpine ____________, Enron ____________, Gas Storage Representative Ed Yates, CA League of Food Processors (customer perspective) Can you get back to me and let me know if and who could participate from Enron? Thanks for your help. Delaney P.S. You better be planning to attend this year -- at least the day sessions! :-)"

We met with Edison yesterday in the attempt to settle our negative CTC claim. ? Edison continues to take a very hard-line, extreme position. This is it in a nutshell: 1. all customers--bundled and DA alike--""contributed to Edison's undercollection"" and all customers must pay it down; 2. bundled customers contributed through frozen rates and DA customers contributed through the negative CTC; 3. Edison says it will pay ESPs past due amounts related to the negative CTC, but it intends to then turn around and assess a charge on all customer bills--DA and bundled alike--to recover its undercollection. 4. Edison intends to collect it over approximately 2 years. Edison estimates that the charge to DA customers over this period would be about $25-27/MWH. 5. Under Edison's plan, Enron would likely end up paying Edison, i.e., the present value of the ""undercollection"" charge would exceed the present value of the lump sum negative CTC payment. ? Obviously, with respect to any settlement with Edison, we're extremely far apart and we're therefore considering other options. ?

It would be an understatement to say that the last year's worth events have been amazing at best. As we discussed at lunch, Enron has developed a unique approach to QF contract restructuring. The main premise is that of conducting a dual auction to determine, on a completely voluntary and open process, the QF buyout economics and the market clearing price for replacement energy. As discussed yesterday, I am enclosing copies of the presentations made to PG&E and SCE on this topic. I would be very interested in your feedback on this concept and on the presentations provided. I must footnote that the economic shown in the presentations are Enron estimates. Individual feedback, particularly in this area would be appreciated. Jeff Dasovitch out of our SF office has been working with me on this proposal and will likely be contacting you within the next day to further discuss this idea as well as the benefits and possible strategies for initiating such an auction process.

Jeff Dasovitch out of our SF office has been working with me on this proposal and will likely be contacting you within the next day to further discuss this idea as well as the benefits and possible strategies for initiating such an auction process. Thanks for your time and look forward to hearing from you.

The electric service providers and customers who are parties shall w= ork with other parties and shall jointly submit a proposed protective order= and nondisclosure agreement that will cover parties other than Commission = staff by December 11, 2001. 4. Parties' supplemental comments to the comments they filed in respons= e to the October 23rd Assigned Commissioner Ruling shall be submitted by Ja= nuary 4, 2002. As a preliminary matter, of course, AReM and WPTF do not, in their own name= s, have direct access contracts.

	smara@enron.com, jdasovic@enron.com","Good draft. Few comments: * As much as we may not like it, the commission is where the action is right now, and we're going to have to work with them. As such, I think the comments would be significantly more effective if you go through the document and edit out the invective and other highly charged adjectives, which, while therapeutic, tend to incent the Commission to ignore or be even more hostile to our interests. In short, I don't see an upside to it and there is downside. Rather than try to edit, I've simply compiled those paragraphs that in my view should be deleted or require serious toning-down. In addition to these specific areas, I would recommend going through the document and toning it down generally. * Seems that it would be useful, up front and at the end, to give OUR answer (maybe I'm repeating Jim's comments here): e.g., The Commission should 1) not do retroactive, 2) permit customers to do what the contracts permit (e.g., add facilities, renew, etc.), 3) hold hearings on all of Wood's unsubstantiated assertions, and 4) anything else we want to be part of the solution as it relates to the issues raised by Karl. * On page 2, do we run the risk of affirming what Angelides and others are saying, i.e., that DA could bankrupt the state? Sure we need to say it, since it seems to play into their spin and everyone already knows of the bind they're in? Could backfire. * Point # 6 on page 14: are we inviting the Commission to ask parties to submit contracts? Possible to re-write or eliminate this so that it doesn't appear we're advocating having folks submit them? Good job. Thanks for your efforts.

Until the next legislative session starts up, the call will be optional for the gang in Sacramento. If you have any alternative suggestions, questions, and/or comments, please let me know. And please forward to others who need/would like to know. Best, Jeff"

After reviewing your presentation, here are some tough questions that we can discuss tomorrow: 1. Would the replacement energy from the market be obtained under contracts of similar length and firmness as the QF contracts that the energy replaces? If not, why would the CPUC want to replace long-term, committed QF power with short-term firm energy? WOULDN'T HAVE TO, BUT PRESUMABLY THE REPLACEMENT POWER WOULD BE CONSIDERABLY MORE ""DISPATCHABLE."" 2. Why would the CPUC want to replace long-term QF power over which it has substantial regulatory leverage (through SRAC pricing) with market energy from sources over which it may have less control? PRICES WOULD BE FIRM AND WOULD REDUCE POWER COSTS TO CONSUMERS SUBSTANTIALLY AND AVOID THE PROTRACTED, COSTLY LITIGATION THAT GOES ON INCESSANTLY BETWEEN EDISON AND QFS. (AND WOULD AVOID ALMOST LOSING THE QFS BASED ON CONTINUED NEGATIVE ACTIONS BY EDISON.) IN SHORT, ENDING THE HOLY WARS IS A GOOD THING. 3. Are there 8,000 MWs of low-cost replacement energy available in California, or in the WSCC with firm transmission to California? How steep is the supply curve for replacement energy? FORECASTS SHOW ONE HELLUVALOT OF POWER COMING ON LINE. HOWEVER, IF THERE WERE CONCERNS, THE MWS COULD BE CAPPED. 4. After a QF is bought out, I assume that it would simply operate in the electric market as a merchant plant, if it continues to operate to provide on-site power and thermal energy. Is this correct? YES. 5. How sensitive are your calculated ratepayer and QF benefits to changes in the relationship between SRAC (i.e. gas) and electric market prices? OBVIOUSLY, VERY CONNECTED. 6. Assuming that there are both ratepayer and QF benefits from QF contract buyouts, why is there a need for a formalized auction process, when the same benefits might be captured through bilateral negotiations (such as the QF buyouts done to date)? BILATERAL NEGOTIATIONS DO NOT EXIST. THEY ARE A MYTH. THIS TRIES TO GET AROUND THAT IMPASSE. 7. Doesn't your proposal require the utilities to be back in the power procurement business? If not, why not? THAT'S A GOOD THING. AND NO MORE THAN THEY WOULD BE OVER THE LIFE OF THE QF CONTRACTS. As you perhaps can tell, my questions focus on whether now is the right time for such a broad plan to buyout QF contracts. THERE ARE ALWAYS REASONS TO CONCLUDE THAT NOW IS NOT THE RIGHT TIME. ON THE OTHER HAND, THERE'S NO TIME LIKE THE PRESENT. AND IF A QF HAS THE OPTION OF 1) RECEIVING THE NPV OF THE QF AND 2) RETAINING CONTROL OF THE ASSET, I'VE STRUGGLED MIGHTILY TRYING TO FIND A DOWNSIDE FOR THE QF. LOOK FORWARD TO TALKING TOMORROW.

I ran across Perfect when I was doing an MBA project--we were required to find a company that we could consult to on e-commerce strategy. I've since found out that Perfect's doing a pilot with EES--acting as the e-procurment platform for products tied to EES' outsourcing deals. From what I hear it's going well, and EES is enthusiastic. The technology is very interesting: soup to nuts e-procurement platform developed by Paul Milgrom (global auction guru and economist at Stanford). Glad you guys can meet with them.

Congratulations on your new role. Sounds exciting (in addition to exhausting). Based on our call, I contacted Perfect Commerce. The two folks from their shop that will be in Houston are: Ian Sullivan SVP, Professional Services and all implementation of the product Cameron Sellers VP, Business Development They'd like to meet sometime during the week of October 15th. Let me know if that works for you and Brad. Or if you'd like to contact them directly, just let me know and I'll get you their numbers/emails. I ran across Perfect when I was doing an MBA project--we were required to find a company that we could consult to on e-commerce strategy. I've since found out that Perfect's doing a pilot with EES--acting as the e-procurment platform for products tied to EES' outsourcing deals. From what I hear it's going well, and EES is enthusiastic. The technology is very interesting: soup to nuts e-procurement platform developed by Paul Milgrom (global auction guru and economist at Stanford). Glad you guys can meet with them. I think it's definitely worth the time--the technology may fit very well with Networks.

(PR) Subject: Colorful Dissent from Two PUC Commissioners Opposed to Suspending DA Commissioners Henry M. Duque and Richard A. Bilas, dissenting: One could say that this order is consistent with the Administration's present third world country mentality. We are punishing the very consumers and providers who made a commitment to ensuring electric restructuring did work by adding a demand retail component to cure the dysfunctions in the wholesale market. We are not convinced that the Department of Water Resources (DWR) bond ratings depend on killing direct access. This notion is a scare tactic and a smoke screen. Direct access comprises such a small percentage of overall demand that it cannot reasonably be seen to be a threat to the sale of the bonds. Direct Access should be seen as a benefit to DWR. It would decrease the amount of the utilities net short obligations and relieve DWR from its power purchasing responsibilities sooner. Something else is going on here. We think that the DWR does not want direct access because if the public is presented with alternatives, it will make DWR's purchasing mistakes abundantly clear. The Commission should be holding hearings to test the assertions being made by DWR, Finance and the Treasurer. Instead, the Commission is making an ill informed, panicked decision to act now and study the repercussions later. DWR and the bonds should not be threatened by direct access if DWR is making prudent energy purchases. Only if DWR's contracts are too expensive, relative to market, will customers seek shelter in lower direct access prices. Indeed, retaining direct access as a way to send price signals to consumers may be the only way to place pressure on DWR to make more prudent purchases. This is a very important consideration since AB 1X prevents us from engaging in any prudency review of the DWR costs to be passed through to ratepayers in order to repay the bonds. If there is no yardstick, how can anyone measure DWR performance? The answer is, one can't, unless SB 18xx is signed into law. We think that additional review of these issues, before suspending direct access, would have produced a more sound decision in the long run. For these reasons we must respectfully dissent. /s/ HENRY M. DUQUE /s/ RICHARD A. BILAS Henry M. Duque Richard A. Bilas Commissioner Commissioner September 20, 2001",3285,"Will do.

Present were Don Sevrens, news editor/insight section; Bill Osborne, senior editor/opinion; Jim Gogek, editorial writer; Bernie Jones, editor, opinion pages; Craig Rose, the reporter who has written extensively on the topic, and a photographer. My two primary messages were that (1) wholesale and retail competition is working elsewhere, particularly in Pennsylvania, and can eventually work in California if the rules are changed, and (2) California has a severe supply shortage and needs to focus on providing incentives for new generation and expediting the permitting process. I was subtly trying to get across the message that leadership was needed to help Californians deal with the need to reconcile their environmental and land use goals with the need to bring their power supply and demand into balance. I, of course, defended FERC's order on the causes of the price volatility in California this summer and their lack of any authority to order retroactive refunds. I also pointed out that there were no findings of individual market abuse, so that refunds wouldn't be warranted even if there was legal authority. I also pointed out the problems with price caps. Other than Craig Rose, who disagreed with me any chance he got, the others asked good questions and seemed to be listening. They made the point repeatedly that this matter is very political, suggesting that a political compromise with the generators/marketers is necessary. One of them said he had heard there was a deal with the generators being negotiated and asked me my position. I responded that I had no response.

Present were Don Sevrens, news editor/insight section; Bill Osborne, senior editor/opinion; Jim Gogek, editorial writer; Bernie Jones, editor, opinion pages; Craig Rose, the reporter who has written extensively on the topic, and a photographer. My two primary messages were that (1) wholesale and retail competition is working elsewhere, particularly in Pennsylvania, and can eventually work in California if the rules are changed, and (2) California has a severe supply shortage and needs to focus on providing incentives for new generation and expediting the permitting process. I was subtly trying to get across the message that leadership was needed to help Californians deal with the need to reconcile their environmental and land use goals with the need to bring their power supply and demand into balance. I, of course, defended FERC's order on the causes of the price volatility in California this summer and their lack of any authority to order retroactive refunds. I also pointed out that there were no findings of individual market abuse, so that refunds wouldn't be warranted even if there was legal authority. I also pointed out the problems with price caps. Other than Craig Rose, who disagreed with me any chance he got, the others asked good questions and seemed to be listening. They made the point repeatedly that this matter is very political, suggesting that a political compromise with the generators/marketers is necessary. One of them said he had heard there was a deal with the generators being negotiated and asked me my position. I responded that I had no response.

This would result in a pretty small percentage. Another way to look at it would be on a % of load basis. If you use the DA load information Sue forwarded to us on October 1st, this % (5.7%) would also be very small. How do you think they will look at it?

Fielder wanted to talk about the negative CTC issue. Here's what he said: They plan to ""settle"" with the ESPs and pay them when they pay everyone else, which he re-iterated would be sometime in Q1'02. Edison is holding firm to the notion that the negative CTC contributed to the utility's undercollection and that the ESP's share of the undercollection has to be netted against the payables attributable to the negative CTC and owed the ESP. He said that they will propose to net it out in one of two ways: 1) lump sum netting (i.e., if they owe $50MM and the share of the undercollection is $30 MM, then they pay the ESP $20 MM; or 2) future reductions in PX Credit (i.e., they pay the ESP $50 MM, and then reduce the PX going forward until the $30 MM is paid down). The numbers are illustrative only. In addition, he said that they have the view that a decision is going to have to be made about 1) whether DA customers pay for stranded costs tied to the DWR L-T contracts, and 2) whether DA customers pay going forward for stranded costs tied to the QF contracts.

Would it be as simple as to determine their total (around $3 billion?) and gross receivable (before any payments - 145 million) and calculate the % (around 5%)? This would result in a pretty small percentage. Another way to look at it would be on a % of load basis. If you use the DA load information Sue forwarded to us on October 1st, this % (5.7%) would also be very small. How do you think they will look at it? I think we would all agree to a 5% haircut, if they would JUST PAY US!

Fielder wanted to talk about the negative CTC issue. Here's what he said: They plan to ""settle"" with the ESPs and pay them when they pay everyone else, which he re-iterated would be sometime in Q1'02. Edison is holding firm to the notion that the negative CTC contributed to the utility's undercollection and that the ESP's share of the undercollection has to be netted against the payables attributable to the negative CTC and owed the ESP. He said that they will propose to net it out in one of two ways: 1) lump sum netting (i.e., if they owe $50MM and the share of the undercollection is $30 MM, then they pay the ESP $20 MM; or 2) future reductions in PX Credit (i.e., they pay the ESP $50 MM, and then reduce the PX going forward until the $30 MM is paid down). The numbers are illustrative only. In addition, he said that they have the view that a decision is going to have to be made about 1) whether DA customers pay for stranded costs tied to the DWR L-T contracts, and 2) whether DA customers pay going forward for stranded costs tied to the QF contracts. (Edison is clearly lobbying the PUC to get DA customers to pay for these costs.) I recommended strongly that he de-link issues 1 and 2 above from the issue of paying us ASAP what they owe us for negative CTC. He agreed. He said that the PUC judge's recently issued pre-hearing conference order requires that Edison ""meet and confer"" with ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th hearing, and that Edison intends to set something up with ESPs prior to that hearing.

The company told the CPUC that Southern California Border (Topock, AZ) prices in the last month have risen by $2.50/MMBtu possibly because of market manipulation, in particular the withholding off of the market of pipeline transportation capacity between the supply basins and the California border. ""[T]here is substantial and compelling evidence that the basis differential has been and continues to be grossly distorted by market power abuse, collusion and affiliate self dealing of out-of-state gas suppliers and merchants,"" Edison told the CPUC. The company noted the CPUC already has filed a Section 5 complaint with FERC regarding this issue and is seeking a recision of ""certain allegedly collusive contracts which it contends have permitted out-of-state natural gas suppliers and their affiliates to drive up artificially California border gas prices by wrongfully withholding capacity."" It notes the complaint ""conservatively estimates that the anti-competitive manipulation of the basis differential has already damaged California gas and electricity users by $100 million annually since the beginning of 1998."" Edison seeks an expedited order authorizing it to use the posted gas price of $4.5133/MMBtu, which was applied to SCE's August 2000 avoided cost posting, to calculate its payment obligations to qualified power producers for the month of October and every month going forward. It estimated September bidweek border prices would average $7/MMBtu. If such prices were used in Edison's September avoided costs posting, its Transition Formula payments to certain independent power producers will be $29 million more than the month prior, the company told the CPUC.

Mike, I understand from our conversation yesterday that your following this on behalf of Questar. Do we know if the other pipelines have been active in any discussions on this bill? What about the generators? Have then been involved, since presumably, their in need of lots more capacity (and they're referenced in the bill)? What about large customers? They been screaming for more infrastructure, too, and many have blamed SoCalGas (and the PUC) for not delivering it. Do we know if pipelines, generators, large customers are supporting or opposing the bill? I'll try to check around, too, in between the electric mayhem. There doesn't seem to be anything in the bill that prevents the interstates from building into the state. If that's true, wouldn't the PUC take those projects into account when doing its analysis and only require the utility to construct (and noncore to take) capacity that isn't already being met by others (i.e., interstates) bringing pipe into the state? Any info you can provide on these fronts would be very useful. Don't want Enron too far out in front of opposition until we find out a bit more regarding 1) whose fer and agin it and 2) analysis of what the bill actually does/does not do.

What about the generators? Have then been involved, since presumably, their in need of lots more capacity (and they're referenced in the bill)? What about large customers? They been screaming for more infrastructure, too, and many have blamed SoCalGas (and the PUC) for not delivering it. Do we know if pipelines, generators, large customers are supporting or opposing the bill? I'll try to check around, too, in between the electric mayhem. There doesn't seem to be anything in the bill that prevents the interstates from building into the state. If that's true, wouldn't the PUC take those projects into account when doing its analysis and only require the utility to construct (and noncore to take) capacity that isn't already being met by others (i.e., interstates) bringing pipe into the state? Any info you can provide on these fronts would be very useful. Don't want Enron too far out in front of opposition until we find out a bit more regarding 1) whose fer and agin it and 2) analysis of what the bill actually does/does not do. Thanks again for the heads up.

Contract terms allow for renewal, or extension, by written agreement of the parties. Commencing on May 1, 2001 Enron agreed to pay Ken $4000/month at a maximum of 25 hours/month. Hours worked in excess of 25/month are paid at a rate of $160/hour. Termination of the contract requires that Enron give Ken Smith 30 days advance notice. If we choose to terminate, I suggest that Karen Denne contact Ken by telephone and also provide written notice of the termination immediately (unless you all agree that we should extend the contract). Please let me and Karen know how you want to proceed by close of business Thursday. Thanks"

If the Legislature doesn't get the MOU out well in advance of September 14th, Edison won't be focused, and I'd suggest that we try and reschedule. No matter the forum, the proposal will be tough to get through, even though it makes alot of economic sense. It's a big change, and big changes don't come easy, no matter the benefits. That said, no shots, no ducks. We ought to make a push. The proposal may not be contingent on Legislation. It might be possible to make it happen at the California PUC. Assignment to DWR would be significant and might require legislation (need to ask a QF lawyer). The proposal makes sense for both the IOUs and DWR, since both want as much ""headroom"" as possible in rates to cover their respective revenue requirements. Given the pending rate agreement between the CA PUC and DWR, and the utilities' messed-up financial position, DWR is clearly the preferable counter party from credit perspective. All that said, none of the above matters much unless the utility, a critical mass of QFs and the PUC's consumer advocate (""ORA"") buy into the idea. I'd propose that we continue with Edison. If Edison bites, then go jointly with Edison to persuade the QFs. If the QFs bite, then go jointly with Edison and QF to try to persuade ORA. On the issue of sleeving through the IOU or DWR, it seems useful to remain flexible on that, though absent general support from the IOUs, QFs and ORA, the entity will be academic.

One of the concerns I have is that the timing is such that it is unlikely, given the legislative session end of September 15th(??), that we are going to get much traction. (Aside from the fact that it seems difficult to convey the nuances of this deal over a conference call). It may not be relevant in this environment, but this idea makes sense. It is an issue of who will listen and who will act. It seems to make sense to propose the structure to DWR. Given the dilemma of how to marry both the Utilities' revenue requirement with that of DWRs on a go forward basis, anything that proposes to lower a portion of either of these revenue demands should be addressed. The proposal to DWR could go as follows: Either Edison and PG&E could separately participate in the dual auction process to buy out the QF agreement and replace with market energy or the contracts could be assigned to DWR and DWR could conduct the dual auction. Assignment of the contracts to DWR would be contingent on a successful auction process. A buyout of the high priced QF agreements would provide for added head room under the rate caps and thus provide a basis for the higher cost DWR contracts. In addition, it appears for our analysis, the savings would be such that you could roll in the outstanding debt owed to the QFs and not exceed the existing payment to the QF under the current capacity plus SRAC pricing. As such it seems that it could be construed as a restructuring of contracts and not a BAIL OUT of SCE. (I say this because my understanding of SB 78 is that a portion of the debt is to pay the back payments owed QFs. Is this portion of the bill being viewed by the radical contingent as a bail out?)

Budhraja was hired by the California Department of Water Resources to negotiate power contracts, but hasn't said which generators he dealt with in the weeks before the Williams contract was signed.

The Attorney General's office recently said it doesn't plan to investigate conflicts of interest involving energy contract negotiations. No one at the office could be reached for comment Monday. The California Public Utilities Commission is also petitioning federal regulators to throw out some of the state's $43 billion in long-term energy contracts, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Monday. The CPUC has argued in filings with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission over the past three months that energy companies took advantage of the state's energy crisis to negotiate high-priced contracts, according to the report. The average price of power under the contracts is $69 a megawatt-hour, more than double peak electricity prices last week.

The Attorney General's office recently said it doesn't plan to investigate conflicts of interest involving energy contract negotiations. No one at the office could be reached for comment Monday. The California Public Utilities Commission is also petitioning federal regulators to throw out some of the state's $43 billion in long-term energy contracts, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Monday. The CPUC has argued in filings with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission over the past three months that energy companies took advantage of the state's energy crisis to negotiate high-priced contracts, according to the report. The average price of power under the contracts is $69 a megawatt-hour, more than double peak electricity prices last week. CPUC lawyers have filed challenges before the FERC on deals negotiated with Scottish Power (SPI <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=SPI>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=SPI>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=SPI>) unit PacifiCorp, Alliance Colton LLC, Sempra Energy (SRE <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=SRE>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=SRE>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=SRE>) and Calpine Corp.

Budhraja disclosed in August that he owned as much as $10,000 in Scottish Power stock while a $1 billion long-term contract with subsidiary PacifiCorp was being hammered out. The state signed the 10-year contract July 6. Budraha sold his stock July 30. State officials say Budhraja had nothing to do with the deal, according to the report."

It could include more bells and whistles, but the intent of this proposal is to get DA back as soon as possible. ************************************************************************** Reduce DWR L-T contract volumes by at least 33-50% To ""back fill"" increase in net-short created by contract reformation, permit noncore customers (20 KW and above) to elect to go DA to fill the position DA provides a significantly more efficient hedge against price volatility than DWR contracts Election is first-come, first-serve, capped at the aggregate net short position Customers decision to go DA will constitute a 3-year commitment to stay DA (i.e., can't go back to IOU for 3 yrs; must stay in the market) If a net short position remains after noncore customers have elected DA (i.e., not enough elect to fill the net short), then the IOUs will hold an auction to fill the net short The auction would seek a portfolio of 3 month, 6 month, 1 year and 3 year deals (both peak and off-peak) to fill the net short. Noncore customers choosing DA would not escape costs of DWR power consumed when the customer was receiving utility service (i.e., prior to electing DA) Likewise, if the noncore customers choosing DA was a utility customer during the period when the utility accured its ""undercollection,"" (i.e., when wholesale prices exceeded the retail cap), the customer would not escape those costs by virtue of electing DA status Noncore customers would not bear responsibility for recovery of DWR L-T contracts. Potential add-on to deal: Core customers (less than 20 KW) could choose ""green only"" DA, but, like, noncore customers could not escape costs for which they are responsible.",5276,"Ms Denne, at Enron, we use the more polite form, ""deep doo-doo.""","-----Original Message----- From: Denne, Karen Sent: Thursday, October 11, 2001 4:37 PM To: Dasovich, Jeff Subject: RE: Conversation w/Jerry Hirsch of LA Times I can't top that.

Best, Jeff ********************************************************************************************************** -----Original Message----- From: Dasovich, Jeff Sent: Tuesday, October 09, 2001 10:53 AM To: Shapiro, Richard; Steffes, James D.; Mara, Susan Subject: Rick: Based on your voicemail, here's a quick-and-dirty synopsis of a proposal that I've been quietly discussing with a select few out here in California (e.g., John White, large customers). It could include more bells and whistles, but the intent of this proposal is to get DA back as soon as possible. ************************************************************************** Reduce DWR L-T contract volumes by at least 33-50% To ""back fill"" increase in net-short created by contract reformation, permit noncore customers (20 KW and above) to elect to go DA to fill the position DA provides a significantly more efficient hedge against price volatility than DWR contracts Election is first-come, first-serve, capped at the aggregate net short position Customers decision to go DA will constitute a 3-year commitment to stay DA (i.e., can't go back to IOU for 3 yrs; must stay in the market) If a net short position remains after noncore customers have elected DA (i.e., not enough elect to fill the net short), then the IOUs will hold an auction to fill the net short The auction would seek a portfolio of 3 month, 6 month, 1 year and 3 year deals (both peak and off-peak) to fill the net short. Noncore customers choosing DA would not escape costs of DWR power consumed when the customer was receiving utility service (i.e., prior to electing DA) Likewise, if the noncore customers choosing DA was a utility customer during the period when the utility accured its ""undercollection,"" (i.e., when wholesale prices exceeded the retail cap), the customer would not escape those costs by virtue of electing DA status Noncore customers would not bear responsibility for recovery of DWR L-T contracts. Potential add-on to deal: Core customers (less than 20 KW) could choose ""green only"" DA, but, like, noncore customers could not escape costs for which they are responsible."

With respect to funding future (more moderate growth), the company does have some room to increase long-term debt (e.g., current ratio for 1986 = 2.26). It seems that HD would get better terms and have increased flexibility by issuing additional debt rather than relying on lines of credit.

Ditto for Nicor. I have a call in to those that know first hand about these latter three utilities so I'll forward that answer as soon as I receive it. Please call if you have any questions or if can be of further assistance. << File: COHdftComp.DOC >> << File: HessCompl.pdf >> << File: HessCompl2.pdf >> Leslie Lawner/ENRON@enronXgate 09/19/2001 02:29 PM To: Janine Migden/ENRON@enronXgate, Jeff Dasovich/ENRON@enronXgate, Roy Boston/HOU/EES@EES cc: Colleen Sullivan/ENRON@enronXgate Subject: FW: OFOs Can you folks help me get the info on OFOs on the LDCs below to Colleen Sullivan, who is working with EES on this. Thanks. -----Original Message----- From: Sullivan, Colleen Sent: Wednesday, September 19, 2001 11:17 AM To: Lawner, Leslie Subject: OFOs Last week I asked you about OFOs and you requested a list of the LDCs we are most interested in. At this time (and in this order), I need any information you can give us on OFO history (frequency, actual dates, reason for OFO--system long or short?, etc.) on the following LDCs: PG&E, Socal NIGAS, Peoples (Chicago), Northshore Columbia of Ohio This is a good starting point for now. Just so you know, we need this data as we are trying to verify/set/modify (whatever you want to call it), the price curves being set by the traders reflecting LDC risk. Obviously, the frequency of OFOs will affect our risk of doing business on a particular LDC, so we need to try to compare and access charges associated with each. Any help or direction you can provide on where to get this data would be most appreciated."

Prior to the meeting the California folks were given a list of topic areas and specific questions relating to the respective topics. I have a list of those questions that I will be happy to provide if your interested. Following are some notes regarding the discussion that took place. The first topic area was about the projected load/resource balance for this summer in California. The Californian's provided a one page listing of the various resources and anticipated loads that they expect to exist this summer. They expect Peak Demand + 7% Reserves to be 61,125 MW's. They have 59,209 in total ""existing resources."" They expect to have 3,050 MW off the existing resources off-line for much of the summer. The net short position is 4,966 MW. Governor Davis expects 5,053 MW of new generation. The Oversight Board and CEC believe this is probably going to be 2,500 MW at best. Many of the numbers were based on some suspect assumptions, including such things as an expectation that BPA will be in a position to make some exports to Cal this summer. A second topic area is air quality. Governor Davis has asked all of the local Air Quality management Districts to relax emission standards for this summer. The problem is that California has some rules requiring older plants to comply with BACT by 1-1-2002. Many plant owners have ordered the equipment to comply and are anticipating being down to install this. There is no single coordinator with reliable information on these planned outages. NW Power Planning Council staff told the Californian's that they should expect the NW Hydro system to be 4000 MW below normal through October, beyond that who knows. It was interesting to listen to the CEC explain how California has gone from a system that didn't allow long-term energy contracts to the current effort to secure long-term contracts with little capability to manage spot and short-term transactions. According to the Cal guys, the state expects to be severely energy constrained starting in June, even if they manage to have capacity. This is largely a function of gas supply. An economist from the Washington State Energy Office said the between 1997 and 2004 Washington has seen a 150 % increase in demand for natural gas. He said Oregon is up 110% in that same time frame. Apparently much of the supply to get through this winter is coming from storage which will have to be replenished, creating a conflict with anticipated generation capability this summer. California is starting to discuss an industrial curtailment program for this summer. Like so many of California's efforts, there is no coordinated effort around this program. The CEC said they are bracing for 20-100 hours of blackouts this summer. While this doesn't sound like a lot, I believe the blackouts at the end of the year were only about 5-10 hours ( this is a guess on my part based on what I recall from news reports).

Redding (PS, NE) (E-mail); Mike Florio (E-mail) Subject: Bond Leg Language, etc. Greetings: Hope everyone had a pleasant 4th. I've read the respective Burton and Hertzberg language on amending AB 1X. The Burton language looks cleaner and simpler, though there may be reasons to include some of the Hertzberg language, too. I'm proposing to the group the following as potential amendments to the bond bill. I would appreciate your feedback. The amendments would be as follows: Customers who were on Direct Access when DWR started buying power (Jan. 17th?), and are still on Direct Access when the bill passes, should be exempt from paying for the bonds. In short, customers should not be forced to pay for power twice--once from their ESP, and once from DWR. Since these customers receive power services from their ESP, they never consumed DWR power in the first place and it wouldn't be fair to require them to pay for it. Customers who have been utility customers since DWR started buying power but subsequently switched to Direct Access should only pay for power provided by DWR that they actually consumed, no more and no less. For example, if a customer was a utility customer when DWR started buying power but switched to Direct Access on May 1st, then the customer would only be responsible for reimbursing DWR for power deliveries that took place from Jan. 17th thru April 30th. I believe that we agreed on these concepts during the negotiations that took place over the past 4-5 weeks. Or if we didn't explicitly agree during the talks, they seem to be principles on which we ought to be able to agree pretty easily now. And rather than leave the issue hanging, which can create unnecessary and costly uncertainty for customers, I suggest that we include very clear and simple legislative language in the bond bill clarifying what customers' obligations are. Your thoughts are appreciated. In addition, we have talked quite a bit about providing customers with incentives in the attempt to get California out of the energy hole that it finds itself in. Providing (20KW and above) customers with an incentive to switch to Direct Access as soon as possible could 1) reduce the net short position that the state (and ultimately consumers) have to finance, thereby reducing spot purchases and price volatility, 2) reduce electricity purchasing costs, and 3) reduce the burden on the state budget. With this in mind, I'm also proposing that the group consider an amendment to the bond bill that would exempt from bond charges any customer that switches to Direct Access by September 1st. Finally, it seems odd that the language directing the PUC to suspend Direct Access is still in the bill. If a dedicated rate component is created, that seems to eliminate altogether the need to suspend Direct Access. And if that's the case, would it make sense to delete that language from the bill? Look forward to your comments and working with you to get support for and passage of the ""core/noncore"" proposal.

Redding (PS, NE) (E-mail); Mike Florio (E-mail) Subject: Bond Leg Language, etc. Greetings: Hope everyone had a pleasant 4th. I've read the respective Burton and Hertzberg language on amending AB 1X. The Burton language looks cleaner and simpler, though there may be reasons to include some of the Hertzberg language, too. I'm proposing to the group the following as potential amendments to the bond bill. I would appreciate your feedback. The amendments would be as follows: Customers who were on Direct Access when DWR started buying power (Jan. 17th?), and are still on Direct Access when the bill passes, should be exempt from paying for the bonds. In short, customers should not be forced to pay for power twice--once from their ESP, and once from DWR. Since these customers receive power services from their ESP, they never consumed DWR power in the first place and it wouldn't be fair to require them to pay for it. Customers who have been utility customers since DWR started buying power but subsequently switched to Direct Access should only pay for power provided by DWR that they actually consumed, no more and no less. For example, if a customer was a utility customer when DWR started buying power but switched to Direct Access on May 1st, then the customer would only be responsible for reimbursing DWR for power deliveries that took place from Jan. 17th thru April 30th. I believe that we agreed on these concepts during the negotiations that took place over the past 4-5 weeks. Or if we didn't explicitly agree during the talks, they seem to be principles on which we ought to be able to agree pretty easily now. And rather than leave the issue hanging, which can create unnecessary and costly uncertainty for customers, I suggest that we include very clear and simple legislative language in the bond bill clarifying what customers' obligations are. Your thoughts are appreciated. In addition, we have talked quite a bit about providing customers with incentives in the attempt to get California out of the energy hole that it finds itself in. Providing (20KW and above) customers with an incentive to switch to Direct Access as soon as possible could 1) reduce the net short position that the state (and ultimately consumers) have to finance, thereby reducing spot purchases and price volatility, 2) reduce electricity purchasing costs, and 3) reduce the burden on the state budget. With this in mind, I'm also proposing that the group consider an amendment to the bond bill that would exempt from bond charges any customer that switches to Direct Access by September 1st. Finally, it seems odd that the language directing the PUC to suspend Direct Access is still in the bill. If a dedicated rate component is created, that seems to eliminate altogether the need to suspend Direct Access. And if that's the case, would it make sense to delete that language from the bill? Look forward to your comments and working with you to get support for and passage of the ""core/noncore"" proposal.

Briefly, some of you know that I attended Berkeley's Policy School. I have been very closely involved with the conference Severin describes in his note to Littlechild. I have been working to try to establish a joint venture between the policy and business schools at Berkeley to hold an ""energy summit,"" where national and international energy leaders would converge on California (under the auspices of UC Berkeley) to talk energy policy. Jim Steffes has helped a lot in brainstorming the idea. In short,, our goal was to have a group of prominent folks squarely refute the extremely retrograde notions of ""turn the clock back"" that the Governor of California's two most recent appointees have been articulating at every opportunity over the past several months, and re-seize the agenda in California. The ""energy heads of state"" at the summit would come up with solutions for going forward. The concept (and invitees) that Severin describes is loosely based on proposals I have made to the ""steering committee."" However, for reasons I won't bore you with in this note, the effort has frankly turned into a fiasco. I notified the group this week that Enron would not be participating, that they should go forward with the conference without us, and that I would help somewhat (contacts, etc.) when (and if) they ever came to agreement on the agenda and particpants. From my perspective, the effort turned out to be a rather big disappointment. I urge us not to get involved or contribute $$s. At this juncture I would recommend against having Ken Lay participate.

Then answer the questions, if you can, or refer them to me or Ken for further follow-up 3)describe your own experience at school and how it has worked with your career--timing, advancement, scheduling, tuition payments, etc. 4)invite them to attend a class so we can show them around.

So, Meg called and asked me to contact one of the individuals on your list of names because that person - Ashish Bhargava- had a specific question around choosing between day and evening programs. Since I had to make a similar decision, Meg thought I should talk to him. If you have already called him, don't worry about it. If not, go ahead and we can trade someone from my list, and I will call Ashish. Just let me know who you pick on my list!

We all have five or six people to call in the next 7-10 days. I made a couple of matches where it seemed there was some kind of similarity in background or career, but for the most part, the assignments were essentially random. The list includes names, phones at home and work, company and title. Remember these are newly admitted students who have not yet accepted our offer of admission. The deadline to accept this offer is April 27th. A general outline of the phone call, should you choose to use it, would be: 1) Congratulations on being admitted to the Haas School 2) indentify yourself as ""involved with the student government at the Haas School, and the evening office asked me to give you a call to see if you had any questions about the program. Then answer the questions, if you can, or refer them to me or Ken for further follow-up 3)describe your own experience at school and how it has worked with your career--timing, advancement, scheduling, tuition payments, etc. 4)invite them to attend a class so we can show them around.

One of the concerns I have is that the timing is such that it is unlikely, given the legislative session end of September 15th(??), that we are going to get much traction. (Aside from the fact that it seems difficult to convey the nuances of this deal over a conference call). It may not be relevant in this environment, but this idea makes sense. It is an issue of who will listen and who will act. It seems to make sense to propose the structure to DWR. Given the dilemma of how to marry both the Utilities' revenue requirement with that of DWRs on a go forward basis, anything that proposes to lower a portion of either of these revenue demands should be addressed. The proposal to DWR could go as follows: Either Edison and PG&E could separately participate in the dual auction process to buy out the QF agreement and replace with market energy or the contracts could be assigned to DWR and DWR could conduct the dual auction. Assignment of the contracts to DWR would be contingent on a successful auction process. A buyout of the high priced QF agreements would provide for added head room under the rate caps and thus provide a basis for the higher cost DWR contracts. In addition, it appears for our analysis, the savings would be such that you could roll in the outstanding debt owed to the QFs and not exceed the existing payment to the QF under the current capacity plus SRAC pricing. As such it seems that it could be construed as a restructuring of contracts and not a BAIL OUT of SCE. (I say this because my understanding of SB 78 is that a portion of the debt is to pay the back payments owed QFs. Is this portion of the bill being viewed by the radical contingent as a bail out?)

The Utility Reform Network and Consumers Union asked Lockyer to examine whether income earned from energy companies by consultant Vikram Budhraja presented a conflict of interest, because he may have been involved in contract negotiations with those companies We believe there is ample evidence for the Attorney General to investigate whether some of the state's electricity contracts were made in violation of California's conflict of interest laws,"" said Bill Ahern, senior policy analyst with Consumers Union West Coast Regional Office. ""If the Attorney General finds that a contract was made in violation of the law, it must be set aside as void."" Three weeks after Budhraja's January hire date, Williams Companies (WMB, news, msgs) won a $3.4 billion contract to provide power to the state over 10 1/2 years. Budhraja disclosed in mid-August that his company, the Electric Power Group, was paid more than $10,000 by Williams during the previous 12 months. Budhraja was hired by the California Department of Water Resources to negotiate power contracts, but hasn't said which generators he dealt with in the weeks before the Williams contract was signed. ""It is reasonable to assume that Budhraja may have been involved in the negotiations that led to the Williams contract,"" Ahern said. ""It is also likely that there are more detailed records and evidence in existence, which only a subpoena or search warrant may uncover."" The groups also are concerned that Budhraja may have held a conflict of interest due to his potential involvement in negotiating a $3.9 billion contract with Allegheny Energy Inc. (AYE, news, msgs) while he owned stocks in energy companies, according to the release. The Attorney General's office recently said it doesn't plan to investigate conflicts of interest involving energy contract negotiations. No one at the office could be reached for comment Monday. The California Public Utilities Commission is also petitioning federal regulators to throw out some of the state's $43 billion in long-term energy contracts, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Monday. The CPUC has argued in filings with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission over the past three months that energy companies took advantage of the state's energy crisis to negotiate high-priced contracts, according to the report. The average price of power under the contracts is $69 a megawatt-hour, more than double peak electricity prices last week. CPUC lawyers have filed challenges before the FERC on deals negotiated with Scottish Power (SPI, news, msgs) unit PacifiCorp, Alliance Colton LLC, Sempra Energy (SRE, news, msgs) and Calpine Corp. (CPN, news, msgs), according to the report. Budhraja disclosed in August that he owned as much as $10,000 in Scottish Power stock while a $1 billion long-term contract with subsidiary PacifiCorp was being hammered out. The state signed the 10-year contract July 6. Budraha sold his stock July 30.

In its decision denying the Petitions, the Commission did however modify its initial decision in several respects. ??????? Key among those is a modification regarding facility adds. ??????? Those comments refer to the ability to continue to submit DASRs for new facilities under contracts signed prior to September 20th that provide for facility adds. ??????? The Commission agreed and has ordered the utilities to accept DASRs for facility adds under contract terms executed prior to 10.20.01. The precise language is cited below. ??????? If you would like a copy of the decision, please contact Joseph Alamo. Best, Jeff ""We reaffirm that for the time being, and unless the Commission states otherwise in a subsequent decision, utilities are required to process DASRs relating to contracts or agreements that were executed on or before September 20th, 2001, including DASRs for service to new facilities or accounts if the underlying contract pursuant to which those DASRs are submitted allowed for the provision of that additional service. Thus, for example, with respect to the specific ESP contract described by UC/CSU in their rehearing application, the utilities are required to accept, even after September 20, 2001, any DASRs they receive that legitimatley relate to that contract...[W]e want to make it clear that...utilities cannot set a deadline after which they could refuse to process DASRs relating to contracts executed on or before September 20, 2001."" pp 20-21"

Fielder wanted to talk about the negative CTC issue. Here's what he said: They plan to ""settle"" with the ESPs and pay them when they pay everyone else, which he re-iterated would be sometime in Q1'02. Edison is holding firm to the notion that the negative CTC contributed to the utility's undercollection and that the ESP's share of the undercollection has to be netted against the payables attributable to the negative CTC and owed the ESP. He said that they will propose to net it out in one of two ways: 1) lump sum netting (i.e., if they owe $50MM and the share of the undercollection is $30 MM, then they pay the ESP $20 MM; or 2) future reductions in PX Credit (i.e., they pay the ESP $50 MM, and then reduce the PX going forward until the $30 MM is paid down). The numbers are illustrative only. In addition, he said that they have the view that a decision is going to have to be made about 1) whether DA customers pay for stranded costs tied to the DWR L-T contracts, and 2) whether DA customers pay going forward for stranded costs tied to the QF contracts. (Edison is clearly lobbying the PUC to get DA customers to pay for these costs.) I recommended strongly that he de-link issues 1 and 2 above from the issue of paying us ASAP what they owe us for negative CTC. He agreed. He said that the PUC judge's recently issued pre-hearing conference order requires that Edison ""meet and confer"" with ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th hearing, and that Edison intends to set something up with ESPs prior to that hearing. Fielder is also the point person on ""getting ESPs paid"" and intends to initiate settlement discussions with ESPs week after next. It was very clear from the conversation that Edison is going to do everything possible (at the expense of creditors) to maximize headroom under the settlement it struck with the PUC a few weeks ago. Edison's stalemate with the QFs is evidence of it. We shouldn't assume anything different with the Negative CTC issue. If you have any questions, let us know. Best, Jeff",3150,"Yes.

California Power-Buying Data Disclosed in Misdirected E-Mail By Daniel Taub Sacramento, California, July 6 (Bloomberg) -- California Governor Gray Davis's office released data on the state's purchases in the spot electricity market -- information Davis has been trying to keep secret -- through a misdirected e-mail. The e-mail, containing data on California's power purchases yesterday, was intended for members of the governor's staff, said Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio. It was accidentally sent to some reporters on the office's press list, he said. Davis is fighting disclosure of state power purchases, saying it would compromise negotiations for future contracts. This week, Davis appealed a state judge's order to release spot-market invoices, purchase orders and confirmation sheets for power contracts signed through June 27.

California paid an average of $132 on the spot market, according to the e-mail. Prices on the spot market tend to be higher than on the day-ahead market.

Fielder wanted to talk about the negative CTC issue. Here's what he said: They plan to ""settle"" with the ESPs and pay them when they pay everyone else, which he re-iterated would be sometime in Q1'02. Edison is holding firm to the notion that the negative CTC contributed to the utility's undercollection and that the ESP's share of the undercollection has to be netted against the payables attributable to the negative CTC and owed the ESP. He said that they will propose to net it out in one of two ways: 1) lump sum netting (i.e., if they owe $50MM and the share of the undercollection is $30 MM, then they pay the ESP $20 MM; or 2) future reductions in PX Credit (i.e., they pay the ESP $50 MM, and then reduce the PX going forward until the $30 MM is paid down). The numbers are illustrative only. In addition, he said that they have the view that a decision is going to have to be made about 1) whether DA customers pay for stranded costs tied to the DWR L-T contracts, and 2) whether DA customers pay going forward for stranded costs tied to the QF contracts. (Edison is clearly lobbying the PUC to get DA customers to pay for these costs.) I recommended strongly that he de-link issues 1 and 2 above from the issue of paying us ASAP what they owe us for negative CTC. He agreed. He said that the PUC judge's recently issued pre-hearing conference order requires that Edison ""meet and confer"" with ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th hearing, and that Edison intends to set something up with ESPs prior to that hearing. Fielder is also the point person on ""getting ESPs paid"" and intends to initiate settlement discussions with ESPs week after next. It was very clear from the conversation that Edison is going to do everything possible (at the expense of creditors) to maximize headroom under the settlement it struck with the PUC a few weeks ago.

Until we see how the direct access suspension implementation issues are resolved, there is a signficant probability that the utilities will insist on seeing all documents related to an ESP agreement, and will go screaming to the commission to turn off your DA service if it appears any portion of the agreement was executed after Sept. 20. As indicated in previous calls, that does not mean an ESP agreement executed prior to Sept 20 cannot be amended as to price and other such terms, but it cannot be extended or renewed so as to give the customer longer access to direct access without raising the risk that the CPUC will invalidate the extension IF it chooses to forbid extensions and renewals after Sept. 20. At this time we do not know when or if the CPUC will address these issues, although as Sue Mara has reported, there will be a Rule 22 meeting in a week which will likely result in utility filings to get clarification from the commission on these issues. Beyond that we have no idea of the procedural schedule the Commission will follow in addressing these issues. Bottom line: The existing commercial deals should not be put at risk by means of amendments as to term of the agreement which were executed after Sept. 20. Follow on extensions or renewals to take effect at the end of the existing agreements can be signed, but will remain at risk untilthe renewal or extension issue is addressed by the Commission. Post Sept. 20 amendments to the price term of existing agreements are very likely safe so long as the pre-Sept 20 term and quantity of the contracts are not altered.

Rick - I just got a call from Ian Fletcher, head of the Utilities Regulation unit at the UK Department of Trade and Industry. He reports to Anna Walker, the Director General of Energy at the DTI. Ian also knows Paul, and I am sure that he only called me because he now knew of my US location. Anyway, here is what he asked: They have a highly regarded junior civil servant, Edward Barker (Paul and I have both met him, and rate him high), who is getting married, and wants to locate to Los Angeles for a year while his fiance/wife completes a Ph.D. at some school there. The UK DTI will keep paying him, so he is effectively free to us. They want a relevant job/work experience for him. Ian does not know about his willingness to commute during the week from San Francisco to LA (I told Ian we were receptive to these kinds of things, if all else worked out), but will check. I think it would be good for Enron (Paul D. may have views on this), not only for endearing Enron to key relationships at DTI, but exposing a UK civil servant to the transparency of our regulation, US-style, cannot hurt either, as that is something Paul is on a long march to improve in the UK. I would think challenging research, attendance at settlement conferences, some memo writing, etc. would be sufficient (actually, that would be a bit below the policy-formation role he now occupies), but do you have any thoughts?

Rick - I just got a call from Ian Fletcher, head of the Utilities Regulation unit at the UK Department of Trade and Industry. He reports to Anna Walker, the Director General of Energy at the DTI. Ian also knows Paul, and I am sure that he only called me because he now knew of my US location. Anyway, here is what he asked: They have a highly regarded junior civil servant, Edward Barker (Paul and I have both met him, and rate him high), who is getting married, and wants to locate to Los Angeles for a year while his fiance/wife completes a Ph.D. at some school there. The UK DTI will keep paying him, so he is effectively free to us. They want a relevant job/work experience for him. Ian does not know about his willingness to commute during the week from San Francisco to LA (I told Ian we were receptive to these kinds of things, if all else worked out), but will check. I think it would be good for Enron (Paul D. may have views on this), not only for endearing Enron to key relationships at DTI, but exposing a UK civil servant to the transparency of our regulation, US-style, cannot hurt either, as that is something Paul is on a long march to improve in the UK. I would think challenging research, attendance at settlement conferences, some memo writing, etc. would be sufficient (actually, that would be a bit below the policy-formation role he now occupies), but do you have any thoughts? I can get his CV when you need it. thanks mcs"

Jim -----Original Message----- From: Swain, Steve Sent: Friday, October 12, 2001 1:19 PM To: Dasovich, Jeff; Mara, Susan; Steffes, James D. Subject: RE: CA question Before we carry this much further, let me explain some more why I raised the question in the first place. We currently assume that our exposure to CTC going forward is zero. Arthur Andersen was questioning this assumption, as market prices in general are lower than embedded gen now (unless you include DWR costs), which implies that if we were under the old CTC regime we could be paying some positive CTC. AA was wondering why we weren't holding some reserves for this eventuality. Mary Lynne and I told them we weren't reserving b/c we just have no clear idea what will happen in the coming months re:CTC, but that in all likelihood zero is the best guess b/c no one can agree on what PX credit (""market"" price) is now that there is no PX. Besides, though SCE and PG&E are arguing for different methods (the so-called ""top-down"" and ""bottom-up""), in the end the result will be about the same (CTC=0), especially now that PG&E has supposedly stopped ""adjusting"" the PX credit to recover past undercollections. And of course, the DWR contracts muddy the waters, since if one includes them in the calculation of utility gen costs, then you could easily get to a negative CTC situation. Bottom line: we think things are so screwed up that everyone will prefer just to ignore CTC for the few months remaining that it has to run. In light of all this we thought we might further quell AA's skepticism if we could show that although we had once argued that DJI should be used as a substitute for PX credit, we were now simply arguing that DA should pay T&D only, and that CTC should become a relic of the past. I think by now it may be a dead issue -- I believe AA has accepted our arguments w/o this extra bit of persuasion, else I would have heard more from Mary Lynne.

Jim -----Original Message----- From: Swain, Steve Sent: Friday, October 12, 2001 1:19 PM To: Dasovich, Jeff; Mara, Susan; Steffes, James D. Subject: RE: CA question Before we carry this much further, let me explain some more why I raised the question in the first place. We currently assume that our exposure to CTC going forward is zero. Arthur Andersen was questioning this assumption, as market prices in general are lower than embedded gen now (unless you include DWR costs), which implies that if we were under the old CTC regime we could be paying some positive CTC. AA was wondering why we weren't holding some reserves for this eventuality. Mary Lynne and I told them we weren't reserving b/c we just have no clear idea what will happen in the coming months re:CTC, but that in all likelihood zero is the best guess b/c no one can agree on what PX credit (""market"" price) is now that there is no PX. Besides, though SCE and PG&E are arguing for different methods (the so-called ""top-down"" and ""bottom-up""), in the end the result will be about the same (CTC=0), especially now that PG&E has supposedly stopped ""adjusting"" the PX credit to recover past undercollections. And of course, the DWR contracts muddy the waters, since if one includes them in the calculation of utility gen costs, then you could easily get to a negative CTC situation. Bottom line: we think things are so screwed up that everyone will prefer just to ignore CTC for the few months remaining that it has to run. In light of all this we thought we might further quell AA's skepticism if we could show that although we had once argued that DJI should be used as a substitute for PX credit, we were now simply arguing that DA should pay T&D only, and that CTC should become a relic of the past. I think by now it may be a dead issue -- I believe AA has accepted our arguments w/o this extra bit of persuasion, else I would have heard more from Mary Lynne. Thanks for all the background and input from everyone, and please let me know if you have any more relevant comments given this context. > -----Original Message----- > From: Dasovich, Jeff > Sent: Friday, October 12, 2001 10:16 AM > To: Mara, Susan; Steffes, James D.; Swain, Steve > Subject: RE: CA question > > Recognizing that it was Sue's idea (though I'm not sure, Sue, > if you're referring to the DJ index or the bottoms-up > approach), isn't it also true that Harry submitted some > testimony more recently regarding the DJ index method, and > didn't ARM more recently submit some bottoms-up testimony, > comments, etc.? > > Best, > Jeff > > -----Original Message----- > From: Mara, Susan > Sent: Friday, October 12, 2001 12:13 PM > To: Dasovich, Jeff; Steffes, James D.; Swain, Steve > Subject: RE: CA question > > All, > > I think I actually was the one who proposed it in a 1998 > ""RAP"" case three years ago.

The vote was 4-1, with the two Republicans voting with Davis' hand-picked appointees Lynch and Wood. Davis' proposal was introduced at the meeting by another Davis appointee--Geoff Brown--who made a lengthy speech about why California would experience economic and political destruction if the PUC did not approve Davis' proposed rate agreement. What is Davis' proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC? It would remove all PUC authority to review any contracts between DWR with suppliers. It would require the PUC to pass through to utility rates all DWR power contract costs, no questions asked. What are the implications of the move by the PUC to reject Davis' proposal? With the vote, it remains unclear how California/DWR will pay for the DWR power contracts. The political pressure to re-negotiate--or break--the DWR power contracts is likely to intensify considerably. It remains unclear how California/DWR will pay for the $12.5 B in bonds the Treasurer has unsuccessfully attempted to issue for past several months. Under the structure devised by Davis, the revenues flowing from the CPUC/DWR rate agreement would be used to both 1) pay for the DWR power contracts and 2) service the bonds the Treasurer is trying to issue to repay California's General Fund for spot and other short term power purchased by DWR since January. In short, there is no clear indication of how California will pay for DWR contracts or issue the bonds. Safe to say that today's PUC vote has seriously embarrassed Davis, and left his approach to ""solving"" California electricity crisis in shambles. What Next? A broad left-right coalition of energy interests supported a bill (18XX) that passed the Legislature with broad bi-partisan support. The bill would create a ""dedicated rate component"" on every customers bill to service the $12.5 B in bonds that the Treasurer wants to issue. Proponents of the bill--and just about everyone else--argue that the ""dedicated rate component"" is a signficantly more efficient way to raise the debt California needs to plug the hole in its budget. The bill is silent, however, on how California would pay for the DWR contracts, and the bill's opponents claim that the power suppliers will sue as a result. All four PUC commissioners who voted against the Davis rate agreement today urged Davis to sign the bill. The left-right coalition (from Nader types to oil companies) is also working hard to get Davis to sign it. Davis has said that he will veto the bill on the advice of the Treasurer and bond counsel. Given today's vote, however, Davis may have no alternative than to sign the bill if he wants to get the bonds issued and the state budget repaid. Update on Edison Bailout Still appears that chances are very small that Edison and Davis will succeed in getting the Legislature to vote for an Edison bailout when it returns for another ""special"" session next Tuesday.

As I mentioned we are looking for an assistant analyst to work in the communications software and wireless area. My current coverage list includes Openwave, Palm, RIMM, Handspring, Comverse, Aether, Nuance, SpeechWorks, etc. Given the way our business is growing and evolving, we will be moving towards names like Qualcomm, Motorola, Nokia, and Ericsson in the very near future. We are looking for all of the clich? characteristics: motivated, high level of initiative, self disciplined, high attention to detail, good writing skills, modeling experience, blah, blah, blah. Potential assistants should expect to take primary responsibility for coverage on lower capitalization companies ASAP and migrate upwards as market conditions improve and research coverage is broadened (within a few months). The position would be based in Portland, OR. Pacific Crest is a full service investment bank focused on the Internet and communications technology companies. The Bank has approximately 100 professionals with primary offices in Portland, OR. Pacific Crest also has offices in Seattle, San Francisco (primarily IB operations), and Boston (Sales and Trading). Most of the professionals at the Bank come from a larger institutions. Before joining Pacific Crest, I was an analyst at Deutsche Bank in London and ING Barings in Latin America. If you have any other questions please feel free to give me a shout. I haven't been too specific on requirements as we are really just looking for the smartest and best people and are less concerned about previous experience, etc. It has been a fairly good hiring strategy to date-since I joined Pacific Crest, we have had zero attrition or turnover. Regards, James P.S. If you are ever in town on a weekday, feel free to come by-we are at the top of the U.S. Bank Tower (big Pinky) and have the best view in Portland. James E.

As I mentioned we are looking for an assistant analyst to work in the communications software and wireless area. My current coverage list includes Openwave, Palm, RIMM, Handspring, Comverse, Aether, Nuance, SpeechWorks, etc. Given the way our business is growing and evolving, we will be moving towards names like Qualcomm, Motorola, Nokia, and Ericsson in the very near future. We are looking for all of the clich? characteristics: motivated, high level of initiative, self disciplined, high attention to detail, good writing skills, modeling experience, blah, blah, blah. Potential assistants should expect to take primary responsibility for coverage on lower capitalization companies ASAP and migrate upwards as market conditions improve and research coverage is broadened (within a few months). The position would be based in Portland, OR. Pacific Crest is a full service investment bank focused on the Internet and communications technology companies. The Bank has approximately 100 professionals with primary offices in Portland, OR. Pacific Crest also has offices in Seattle, San Francisco (primarily IB operations), and Boston (Sales and Trading). Most of the professionals at the Bank come from a larger institutions. Before joining Pacific Crest, I was an analyst at Deutsche Bank in London and ING Barings in Latin America. If you have any other questions please feel free to give me a shout. I haven't been too specific on requirements as we are really just looking for the smartest and best people and are less concerned about previous experience, etc. It has been a fairly good hiring strategy to date-since I joined Pacific Crest, we have had zero attrition or turnover. Regards, James P.S. If you are ever in town on a weekday, feel free to come by-we are at the top of the U.S. Bank Tower (big Pinky) and have the best view in Portland. James E.

I ran across Perfect when I was doing an MBA project--we were required to find a company that we could consult to on e-commerce strategy. I've since found out that Perfect's doing a pilot with EES--acting as the e-procurment platform for products tied to EES' outsourcing deals. From what I hear it's going well, and EES is enthusiastic.

The also propose a return to embedded cost rates, and an elimination of any transmission load risk for the utility. We should discuss whether Enron wishes to participate in this case, which will clearly be a new vehicle for putting gas strategy issues before the commission. Let me know if you need a copy of the application. Mike Day"

The Burton language looks cleaner and simpler, though there may be reasons to include some of the Hertzberg language, too. I'm proposing to the group the following as potential amendments to the bond bill. I would appreciate your feedback. The amendments would be as follows: Customers who were on Direct Access when DWR started buying power (Jan. 17th?), and are still on Direct Access when the bill passes, should be exempt from paying for the bonds. In short, customers should not be forced to pay for power twice--once from their ESP, and once from DWR. Since these customers receive power services from their ESP, they never consumed DWR power in the first place and it wouldn't be fair to require them to pay for it. Customers who have been utility customers since DWR started buying power but subsequently switched to Direct Access should only pay for power provided by DWR that they actually consumed, no more and no less. For example, if a customer was a utility customer when DWR started buying power but switched to Direct Access on May 1st, then the customer would only be responsible for reimbursing DWR for power deliveries that took place from Jan. 17th thru April 30th. I believe that we agreed on these concepts during the negotiations that took place over the past 4-5 weeks. Or if we didn't explicitly agree during the talks, they seem to be principles on which we ought to be able to agree pretty easily now. And rather than leave the issue hanging, which can create unnecessary and costly uncertainty for customers, I suggest that we include very clear and simple legislative language in the bond bill clarifying what customers' obligations are. Your thoughts are appreciated. In addition, we have talked quite a bit about providing customers with incentives in the attempt to get California out of the energy hole that it finds itself in. Providing (20KW and above) customers with an incentive to switch to Direct Access as soon as possible could 1) reduce the net short position that the state (and ultimately consumers) have to finance, thereby reducing spot purchases and price volatility, 2) reduce electricity purchasing costs, and 3) reduce the burden on the state budget. With this in mind, I'm also proposing that the group consider an amendment to the bond bill that would exempt from bond charges any customer that switches to Direct Access by September 1st. Finally, it seems odd that the language directing the PUC to suspend Direct Access is still in the bill. If a dedicated rate component is created, that seems to eliminate altogether the need to suspend Direct Access. And if that's the case, would it make sense to delete that language from the bill?

Cc: Sharp, Vicki; Higgason, Kelly; Maynard, Michelle Subject: Extensions of CA Deals CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY CLIENT COMMUNICATION I'd like to get some thoughts on this issue and hopefully build a consensus pretty quickly. We are in the process of extending the term of some of our existing CA deals that we executed on the Master in June. Understanding that ""new"" deals struck after 9/20 are, and extensions of existing deals may be, at risk, it seems to me we have three basic options in order to effect this extension, and I want to make sure we evaluate and choose the one that minimizes the risk that the extension is invalidated. Note that DASR's have been submitted for the subject accounts under the original Transactions. The 3 choices I see are: 1. .Amend and Restate the existing Transaction Confirmation to add the extension and new price for the extension. In this case, the extension would be wrapped up on one document that is signed after 9/20 but effective in June. 2. Simply amend the existing Transaction to add extended term and price. This would be a separate document. 3. Execute a whole new Transaction for the extended term, which would be effective when signed but the services and price under which would not start until after the expiration of the existing Transaction. The existing Transaction would stay in tact as written. It seems to me that choice number 3 is the safest overall. The amended and restated route has appeal because the whole transaction is dated back to June. However, if a regulator were to peel it back, the conclusion could be that the deal was struck after Sept 20 and therefore the whole transaction was invalid, including the original structure.

Cc: Sharp, Vicki; Higgason, Kelly; Maynard, Michelle Subject: Extensions of CA Deals CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY CLIENT COMMUNICATION I'd like to get some thoughts on this issue and hopefully build a consensus pretty quickly. We are in the process of extending the term of some of our existing CA deals that we executed on the Master in June. Understanding that ""new"" deals struck after 9/20 are, and extensions of existing deals may be, at risk, it seems to me we have three basic options in order to effect this extension, and I want to make sure we evaluate and choose the one that minimizes the risk that the extension is invalidated. Note that DASR's have been submitted for the subject accounts under the original Transactions. The 3 choices I see are: 1. .Amend and Restate the existing Transaction Confirmation to add the extension and new price for the extension. In this case, the extension would be wrapped up on one document that is signed after 9/20 but effective in June. 2. Simply amend the existing Transaction to add extended term and price. This would be a separate document. 3. Execute a whole new Transaction for the extended term, which would be effective when signed but the services and price under which would not start until after the expiration of the existing Transaction. The existing Transaction would stay in tact as written. It seems to me that choice number 3 is the safest overall. The amended and restated route has appeal because the whole transaction is dated back to June. However, if a regulator were to peel it back, the conclusion could be that the deal was struck after Sept 20 and therefore the whole transaction was invalid, including the original structure. I think that choice 2, though creating a separate document for the extension, could fall into the same trap. In that sense, choice 3 seems safest because arguably the original transaction is not at risk. If the extension is invalidated, that determination would likely not claw back to the original deal. The commercial teams want to close these extensions in Q3 so they are moving fast. Please let me know your thoughts asap. If we need to have a quick call, I can set something up. Thanks. MDS"

The purpose of the meeting was to brief us on their activities and their gameplan for trying to find a solution for California. Here's a summary of the meeting. Please keep confidential. Work will be done over the weekend to put the core/noncore proposal in legislative language. (We will be in the room.) Work done by the ""Plan B"" group in the Assembly (Joe Dutra and Joe Nation) will also be put into legislative language over the weekend. Because no proposal is ""comprehensive,"" a complete legislative package will be created from the various pieces that have been worked on thus far (i.e., core/noncore, ""Plan B,"" Edison MOU) In addition, there are Republican demands that Hertzberg will need to address (e.g., end the litigation) in order to achieve bi-partison support, which is what Hertzberg's shooting for. To move the legislation, the plan is to establish a ""conference committee,"" comprised of an equal number of Democrats and Republicans. The committe would begin work on Monday and would attempt to finish putting a comprehensive bill together, vote it out of the Legislature and send it to the Governor for signing by Monday, July 16th. July 16th is the deadline because that is the date that the PUC will issue its proposed decision regarding, among other things, how DWR's revenue requirement will be put into rates, whether Direct Access needs to be suspended, etc. The PUC is issuing the draft on the 16th in order to give everyone 30 days to review and comment before the Commission votes on a final order on August 15th.

The purpose of the meeting was to brief us on their activities and their gameplan for trying to find a solution for California. Here's a summary of the meeting. Please keep confidential. Work will be done over the weekend to put the core/noncore proposal in legislative language. (We will be in the room.) Work done by the ""Plan B"" group in the Assembly (Joe Dutra and Joe Nation) will also be put into legislative language over the weekend. Because no proposal is ""comprehensive,"" a complete legislative package will be created from the various pieces that have been worked on thus far (i.e., core/noncore, ""Plan B,"" Edison MOU) In addition, there are Republican demands that Hertzberg will need to address (e.g., end the litigation) in order to achieve bi-partison support, which is what Hertzberg's shooting for. To move the legislation, the plan is to establish a ""conference committee,"" comprised of an equal number of Democrats and Republicans. The committe would begin work on Monday and would attempt to finish putting a comprehensive bill together, vote it out of the Legislature and send it to the Governor for signing by Monday, July 16th. July 16th is the deadline because that is the date that the PUC will issue its proposed decision regarding, among other things, how DWR's revenue requirement will be put into rates, whether Direct Access needs to be suspended, etc. The PUC is issuing the draft on the 16th in order to give everyone 30 days to review and comment before the Commission votes on a final order on August 15th. (The PUC will actually issue a ""thought piece"" on Monday the 9th and will use reactions to the ""thought piece"" to craft the develop the proposed decision it plans to issue on the 16th.) All of this is still up in the air, however. As of right now, the leader of the Senate (Burton) has not agreed to Hertzberg's gameplan and the Republicans, while interested, have not yet committed to join the process."

Summary of our offer: Edison pays us 90% of what they owe us as of 01.17.01. Payment structure: Edison pays us 10% immediately, with an agreed to (speedy) payment schedule for the remaining 90%. In return, we drop our complaint against Edison at the PUC. In return, we agree to a bottoms-up approach retroactive to March 1 to replace the current PX Credit/Residual CTC framework. Fielder said that he didn't see any show-stoppers in our proposal, but had to check back on his end. However, there were three additional issues that he wanted to add to any deal: Some agreement regarding payment of Edison's undercollection (this would cover any of our DA customers who were bundled services customers pre-January 17). We agreed that this would only be an issue to the extent that the Legislature and/or the PUC agreed that Edison should get authority to recoup its undercollection in rates. Some agreement on DWR stranded costs. John expressed the view that DWR bought power under the assumption that the customers who've recently gone DA would be there to take the power, and now that they've left, they should contribute in some way to any stranded costs. I told John that this issue is a hornet's nest, that we were better off leaving it out, but we'd consider his proposals. Some agreement on forebearance. I told John that if Edison agrees to pay us, it didn't seem that forebearance would be off the table. We agreed to touch base at the same time Wednesday morning. The idea is that he'll get back to me with Edison's reaction to our proposal; and we'd get back to him on Edison's proposals. Might be useful to determine whether we want to continue the discussions. While John seemed very inclined to work something out, all signals are that the Legislature isn't inclinded to bail Edison out next week. In which case, Edison could be in bankruptcy in a couple of weeks, which would presumably nullify any agreement we might reach with them. On the other hand, if the Legislature pulls a rabbit out of a hat, an agreement might have real value. Any comments folks have on 1) Edison's proposals and 2) whether it makes sense to continue discussions on Wednesday are appreciated. Seems that, at a minimum, if we agree to consider Edison's proposals, then our payment should go from 90 cents to 100 cents on the dollar.

I told John that if Edison agrees to pay us, it didn't seem that forebearance would be off the table. We agreed to touch base at the same time Wednesday morning. The idea is that he'll get back to me with Edison's reaction to our proposal; and we'd get back to him on Edison's proposals. Might be useful to determine whether we want to continue the discussions. While John seemed very inclined to work something out, all signals are that the Legislature isn't inclinded to bail Edison out next week. In which case, Edison could be in bankruptcy in a couple of weeks, which would presumably nullify any agreement we might reach with them. On the other hand, if the Legislature pulls a rabbit out of a hat, an agreement might have real value. Any comments folks have on 1) Edison's proposals and 2) whether it makes sense to continue discussions on Wednesday are appreciated. Seems that, at a minimum, if we agree to consider Edison's proposals, then our payment should go from 90 cents to 100 cents on the dollar. Best, Jeff"

Fielder wanted to talk about the negative CTC issue. Here's what he said: They plan to ""settle"" with the ESPs and pay them when they pay everyone else, which he re-iterated would be sometime in Q1'02. Edison is holding firm to the notion that the negative CTC contributed to the utility's undercollection and that the ESP's share of the undercollection has to be netted against the payables attributable to the negative CTC and owed the ESP. He said that they will propose to net it out in one of two ways: 1) lump sum netting (i.e., if they owe $50MM and the share of the undercollection is $30 MM, then they pay the ESP $20 MM; or 2) future reductions in PX Credit (i.e., they pay the ESP $50 MM, and then reduce the PX going forward until the $30 MM is paid down). The numbers are illustrative only. In addition, he said that they have the view that a decision is going to have to be made about 1) whether DA customers pay for stranded costs tied to the DWR L-T contracts, and 2) whether DA customers pay going forward for stranded costs tied to the QF contracts. (Edison is clearly lobbying the PUC to get DA customers to pay for these costs.) I recommended strongly that he de-link issues 1 and 2 above from the issue of paying us ASAP what they owe us for negative CTC. He agreed. He said that the PUC judge's recently issued pre-hearing conference order requires that Edison ""meet and confer"" with ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th hearing, and that Edison intends to set something up with ESPs prior to that hearing. Fielder is also the point person on ""getting ESPs paid"" and intends to initiate settlement discussions with ESPs week after next. It was very clear from the conversation that Edison is going to do everything possible (at the expense of creditors) to maximize headroom under the settlement it struck with the PUC a few weeks ago. Edison's stalemate with the QFs is evidence of it. We shouldn't assume anything different with the Negative CTC issue. If you have any questions, let us know.

 not needed until mid August",jeff.dasovich@enron.com,susan.mara@enron.com,"Thanks, Sue. FYI--this new schedule was discussed a lot last week, and apparently was a big part of the meeting that occured with Davis' people and Angelides last Thursday nite. It was a move to buy time to try and get a comprehensive settlement in place in the legislature (i.e., core/noncore). In addition to buying time to save Direct Access, it also gives Angelides more time to get the bonds lined up, which seems to be an increasingly challenging task---there's growing speculation that the issuance will be much more difficult than Angelides has thus far let on. That said, I need to check around, but there is some chance that the plan/agreement is that the PUC decisions would go out well in advance of August (with effective date being August), which would then provide enough time to let the expedited ""appeals process"" under (SB37?) run its course in time for the issuance in Sept/Oct. In short, we'll need to remain vigilant energized because there's a chance that the decisions to which Angelides refers in the memo could be up at the Commission sooner rather than later.

Best, Jeff CONSUMER POWER AND CONSERVATION FINANCING AUTHORITY Pace of Power Authority Renewable Portfolio Agenda is Slowed Quite possibly the most significant action taken at the October 19 Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority (Power Authority) was its inaction on contracts proposed for approval. The Power Authority has aggressively pursued a broad renewable portfolio, with the intent to approve contracts as soon as possible. Instead of approving a number of contracts on its October 19 agenda, the Power Authority deferred calendared decisions on request for bids until its November 2 meeting, acknowledging that no action can be taken until the Department of Water Resources (DWR) rate agreement stalemate has been resolved. Chairman Freeman stated that the Public Utility Commission's rejection of the rate agreement has created an obstacle for the Power Authority to exercise renewable contracts, to contract for peaker generation and/or to implement demand side programs. The Power Authority relies upon DWR's credit to fund these programs, and until a rate agreement is finalized the Power Authority cannot sign contracts. Freeman indicated that the Power Authority has signed letters of intent to purchase output from 14 biomass facilities in the Central Valley, as well as 400 MW generated by wind. With the Current Glut of Contracts, Why Do We Need Additional Reserves? Kellan Flukinger, Senior Advisor to Chairman Freeman and Laura Doll, provided a detailed presentation explaining why he believes the Power Authority must contract for additional renewable and peaking generation. Flukinger believes that despite direct access and the current glut of electricity supplied in long-term contracts, there still appears to be a net short of a few thousand megawatts within the State. Flukinger concluded that the State still is at the mercy of electric generators who are not subject to PUC regulatory authority and who have no real obligation to build and maintain new facilities or to serve customers within the State. He believes that the short-term contracts and spot purchases leave the state vulnerable to price-spikes and supply shortages. He believes that the reserve can be managed through Time-of-Use and Real-Time-Pricing, conservation, interruptibles, demand side management, renewables and peakers.

General May want to point out that the roots of California's current gas woes are the same ones causing the electric problem---combined effect of California's ""import-based"" energy policy and the state's failure to invest in in-state infrastructure. California imports about 25% of its electricity, but about 80-90 percent of its gas supply. California has failed to invest in the in-state infrastructure necessary to support increased gas demand over the last decade. So we've got an interstate pipeline superhighway to the border and a dirt road of in-state transportation once you get into California. The last bullet seems to suggest that manipulation may be taking place. Can we support that suggestion, and is it one that we want to make necessarily?

SACRAMENTO -- Gov. Gray Davis is crafting a new plan to expedite the long-delayed borrowing of $12.5 billion to repay the sagging California state budget for emergency electricity it bought during the energy crisis. The plan -- which could be contained in an executive order as early as next week -- would minimize the role of the state's top power regulator, the Public Utilities Commission, which enraged Davis last week when it declined to sign off on his original plan. With enough power now under contract to avert blackouts and plans in place for the recovery of the two state's largest utilities, the repayment to the state treasury would resolve one of the last remaining issues of the energy crisis. ""That is one scenario,"" Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean said Wednesday when asked about the proposal. ""There are a number of different scenarios being considered. Nothing has jelled yet that is ready to be publicly announced."" Most involved in the debate have long agreed that the state should sell $12.5 billion in revenue bonds, most of which, about $9.6 billion, would go back into the state treasury. The issue was how to lock in a mechanism by which the bonds would be repaid - a critical step before they could be marketed to investors. Davis wanted the PUC to approve a plan that would repay the bonds and cover the state's energy costs through the revenues collected from ratepayers. But the PUC said the administration's proposal might prove inadequate over time, leading to future rate hikes. The PUC also said the administration's plan gave too much authority to the Davis-controlled Department of Water Resources, by allowing the department to raise electricity rates to get more revenue. The PUC, which is set up to be an independent board with the sole responsibility for setting utility rates, did not want to cede that authority. It rejected the Davis plan Oct. 2 on a 4-1 vote, led by its president, Davis appointee Loretta Lynch. Davis earlier said the commission's approval was necessary to reassure investors and get the bonds to market. The plan now under review, however, would bypass that. The DWR would not directly set rates, but under the Davis plan it would be charged with identifying how the money coming in from customers' utility bills over the next 20 years would be allocated - in effect, guaranteeing that paying back the bonds would have equal priority with paying back the suppliers of the energy. Proponents of the plan believe that would satisfy Wall Street. The administration believes it would require no additional rate hikes. Lynch said Wednesday that she had not been involved in the latest negotiations, but questioned whether Davis had the authority to issue an executive order allowing the DWR to get involved in setting rates. ""I've been told for six months that the PUC was needed to pass a rate agreement. If the DWR can get the bonds sold by themselves, then great,"" Lynch said. ""But to dedicate rates, it takes a financing order from the PUC or a statutory change in law, a statutory set-aside. It takes one of those two things.""

SACRAMENTO -- Gov. Gray Davis is crafting a new plan to expedite the long-delayed borrowing of $12.5 billion to repay the sagging California state budget for emergency electricity it bought during the energy crisis. The plan -- which could be contained in an executive order as early as next week -- would minimize the role of the state's top power regulator, the Public Utilities Commission, which enraged Davis last week when it declined to sign off on his original plan. With enough power now under contract to avert blackouts and plans in place for the recovery of the two state's largest utilities, the repayment to the state treasury would resolve one of the last remaining issues of the energy crisis. ""That is one scenario,"" Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean said Wednesday when asked about the proposal. ""There are a number of different scenarios being considered. Nothing has jelled yet that is ready to be publicly announced."" Most involved in the debate have long agreed that the state should sell $12.5 billion in revenue bonds, most of which, about $9.6 billion, would go back into the state treasury. The issue was how to lock in a mechanism by which the bonds would be repaid - a critical step before they could be marketed to investors. Davis wanted the PUC to approve a plan that would repay the bonds and cover the state's energy costs through the revenues collected from ratepayers. But the PUC said the administration's proposal might prove inadequate over time, leading to future rate hikes. The PUC also said the administration's plan gave too much authority to the Davis-controlled Department of Water Resources, by allowing the department to raise electricity rates to get more revenue. The PUC, which is set up to be an independent board with the sole responsibility for setting utility rates, did not want to cede that authority. It rejected the Davis plan Oct. 2 on a 4-1 vote, led by its president, Davis appointee Loretta Lynch. Davis earlier said the commission's approval was necessary to reassure investors and get the bonds to market. The plan now under review, however, would bypass that. The DWR would not directly set rates, but under the Davis plan it would be charged with identifying how the money coming in from customers' utility bills over the next 20 years would be allocated - in effect, guaranteeing that paying back the bonds would have equal priority with paying back the suppliers of the energy. Proponents of the plan believe that would satisfy Wall Street. The administration believes it would require no additional rate hikes. Lynch said Wednesday that she had not been involved in the latest negotiations, but questioned whether Davis had the authority to issue an executive order allowing the DWR to get involved in setting rates. ""I've been told for six months that the PUC was needed to pass a rate agreement. If the DWR can get the bonds sold by themselves, then great,"" Lynch said. ""But to dedicate rates, it takes a financing order from the PUC or a statutory change in law, a statutory set-aside. It takes one of those two things."" The governor is likely to announce the plan sometime following his expected veto of the bill that lays out the Legislature's version of the payback plan. By law, the governor has until Sunday to act on SB18xx, by Senate Leader John Burton, D-San Francisco. Davis opposes Burton's bill because it gives bond buyers priority in getting paid, followed by the energy suppliers.

It does qualify this statement by discussing where potential bottlenecks in delivery might occur and recommends actions to address the bottlenecks. See below for a link to the report. Mary Schoen Environmental Strategies Enron Corp 415.782.7803 (phone) 415.782.7854 (fax) For immediate release: October 3, 2001 Contact: Claudia Chandler : 916-654-4989 Energy Commission Report Projects Improved Natural Gas Supplies For the State Sacramento -While current natural gas prices in California have dropped to approximately half of 2000's average price, the specter remains of last December, when tight supplies caused prices to spike to 25 times their present rates. Now, as winter approaches, industry watchers wonder if the State has enough of the clean-burning fuel for the upcoming heating season, even as new gas-fired electricity generators come on line. The Natural Gas Infrastructure Issues Report , adopted today by a 4-to-0 vote of the California Energy Commission, gives a qualified ""yes"" to the question of adequate supplies this winter. It identifies sufficient storage as a critical factor, and notes that utilities have substantially increased natural gas storage, largely because conservation and efficiency have dampened summer electricity demand. Nearly 85 percent of the natural gas used by Californians comes by pipeline from gas fields located outside the State. Since California typically uses more natural gas in the winter than interstate pipelines can provide, additional supplies must be set aside in summer months to help balance supply and demand. For this reason, the report recommends that the Energy Commission continuously assess storage levels and monitor infrastructure improvements throughout the year. The newly adopted report points out that California's natural gas supply system was designed years ago to provide enough gas for winter's peak heating demand. An increasing reliance on natural gas for generating electricity, however, has strained the system and revised old patterns of consumption. ""This report helps Californians understand what we have to do to assure that we have a reliable and reasonably priced electricity and natural gas system in the future,"" said Energy Commissioner Michal (spelling correct) Moore, Presiding Member of the Electricity and Natural Gas Committee that developed the document. To help resolve possible supply problems, the document analyzes not only natural gas storage requirements but the interstate pipelines that bring the fuel from distant gas fields to the California border. These pipelines can deliver slightly more natural gas than intra-state gas pipelines ? those within our State's borders ? can receive. As a result, there are bottlenecks in getting some supplies to gas consumers that the report says must be improved. Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) and Southern California Gas Company (SoCal Gas) are improving and expanding their intra-state pipeline systems to help eliminate these constraints. According to the report, planned expansions of the interstate pipeline network should increase natural gas delivery to the State beginning next year, and additional improvements to the natural gas system should help prevent higher-than-normal prices that plagued California last winter. Natural gas supplies in North America appear to be sufficient to meet demand in California and the rest of the United States for the next 50 years. The report recommends that the Energy Commission continue to monitor drilling rig activity and production levels for the long-term outlook. It also suggests that the Energy Commission, along with the Public Utilities Commission, should find ways to encourage and increase the in-state supply of natural gas.

In both situations, our hours were required by the expanded press of the work in the hearing, and the uncertainty that is involved in estimating the cost of hearing work is always difficult to deal with.

Also, the certificate itself needs to be renewed every 2 years (FYI--I don't think I saw that requirement in the chart) Other items such as participation in the One Call Notice System and the tax contributions might fall into the commercial category. These requirements not only need to be kept track of and adherred to, but there is also the consideration of what the resource costs are associated with them for both the IXC certifcations and the CLEC certifications.

Also, the certificate itself needs to be renewed every 2 years (FYI--I don't think I saw that requirement in the chart) Other items such as participation in the One Call Notice System and the tax contributions might fall into the commercial category. These requirements not only need to be kept track of and adherred to, but there is also the consideration of what the resource costs are associated with them for both the IXC certifcations and the CLEC certifications. And are there penalties in place if we don't comply? Scott/Donald/Sue--can we discuss next call?

This project was meant to incorporate California and Florida; however, I have not yet received any information from our counsel in CA and I only received the pertinent information from our counsel in Florida late last night and this morning. I apologize that I was not able to include any information from those states. I will incorporate their information when I return from vacation. I have asked Gloria to provide some of you with copies of the material that I received from Florida to utilize in my absence (e.g., Sue, Donald, Scott). You should already have the material from TX, IL and NY. Please let me know if anyone has any questions or concerns. Thank you. Regards, Lara"

California Lawmakers Vote to Limit Power Costs By Rebecca Smith 09/01/2000 The Wall Street Journal Page A4 (Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) California lawmakers voted to extend modest relief to San Diego residents burdened with high electricity bills and set the groundwork for faster construction of badly needed power plants. They stopped short, however, of passing legislation that would roll back retail power rates to levels seen prior to deregulation . Late Wednesday, lawmakers sent a bill to Gov. Gray Davis that limits to 6.5 cents per kilowatt hour the amount that small customers of San Diego Gas & Electric Co. can be charged. The utility is allowed to add power-delivery and other reasonable costs to that commodity price. The price, equivalent to a bulk power cost of $65 per megawatt hour, is far higher than the average price of power for 27 of the 31 months in which California's market has been deregulated. But in June and July, the average price of power obtained by the utility from a state-sanctioned energy auction rose to 12 cents and 10.5 cents, respectively, compared with the 2.3 cents and 2.8 cents charged in those months a year earlier. Passed directly through to customers,the resulting bills sparked a near mutiny. The rate-cap measure applies to residential and small commercial customers, as well as to schools and hospitals. In addition to the rate cap, which can be adjusted upward or downward by the California Public Utilities Commission until December 2002, the legislature earmarked $150 million of general-fund revenue, which can be used to subsidize San Diego power costs if they greatly exceed the 6.5-cents-per-kilowatt-hour rate. For now, the utility would be expected to make up any difference between revenue collected and the actual cost. Steve Baum, chairman of Sempra Energy, parent of San Diego Gas & Electric Co., said the rate-cap measure is ""deeply flawed"" because it limits the amount prices can rise but sets no floor. That means any shortfall could grow -- without a mechanism for customers to pay it down -- until the end of the rate-cap period, which could last until December 2002 or December 2003. Mr. Baum said Sempra stands to suffer an undercollection of perhaps $664 million, provided future prices approximate the New York Mercantile Exchange forward prices through December 2002. ""It's irreparably damaging to Sempra,"" he said because it ""creates tremendous uncertainty"" that makes it hard for the San Diego energy company to finance new projects such as a new transmission line. The legislature also appeared likely to approve a bill speeding up the permit process for the construction of new power plants, in part by beefing up staffs of regulatory agencies that review the plans.

We are currently working on the Memorandum of Points and Authorities and anticipate sending a draft sometime tomorrow morning. The Petition is based on the assumption that the Commission will adopt an order with retroactive application. If the Commissions issues an Order consistent with the draft Interim Decision published today, then retroactivity will not be an issue and there wll be no need to seek judicial relief (at least on that ground). Enron Energy Services, Inc., is named as the Petitioner. I am uncertain, however, whether this is the correct name or entity. The Petition must be filed in the Supreme Court because the Legislature conferred exclusive and original jurisdiction on it when Public Utilities Code section 1768 was enacted. The Petition does not address the timeliness of the request for Supreme Court review. Generally, all administrative remedies must be exhausted before a Petition is timely and Section 1768 appears to require that an application for rehearing be denied before a Petition can be filed. Since there will undoubtedly be an argument that the Petition is premature because there has been no application for a rehearing, the Points and Authorities (and probably the Petition) will discuss the timeliness of the Petition. The exceptions to the exhaustion doctrine should control making the Petition timely. Dan Douglass and I will be available for your 1 p.m. conference call.

Summary of our offer: Edison pays us 90% of what they owe us as of 01.17.01. Payment structure: Edison pays us 10% immediately, with an agreed to (speedy) payment schedule for the remaining 90%. In return, we drop our complaint against Edison at the PUC. In return, we agree to a bottoms-up approach retroactive to March 1 to replace the current PX Credit/Residual CTC framework. Fielder said that he didn't see any show-stoppers in our proposal, but had to check back on his end. However, there were three additional issues that he wanted to add to any deal: Some agreement regarding payment of Edison's undercollection (this would cover any of our DA customers who were bundled services customers pre-January 17). We agreed that this would only be an issue to the extent that the Legislature and/or the PUC agreed that Edison should get authority to recoup its undercollection in rates. Some agreement on DWR stranded costs. John expressed the view that DWR bought power under the assumption that the customers who've recently gone DA would be there to take the power, and now that they've left, they should contribute in some way to any stranded costs. I told John that this issue is a hornet's nest, that we were better off leaving it out, but we'd consider his proposals. Some agreement on forebearance. I told John that if Edison agrees to pay us, it didn't seem that forebearance would be off the table. We agreed to touch base at the same time Wednesday morning. The idea is that he'll get back to me with Edison's reaction to our proposal; and we'd get back to him on Edison's proposals. Might be useful to determine whether we want to continue the discussions. While John seemed very inclined to work something out, all signals are that the Legislature isn't inclinded to bail Edison out next week. In which case, Edison could be in bankruptcy in a couple of weeks, which would presumably nullify any agreement we might reach with them. On the other hand, if the Legislature pulls a rabbit out of a hat, an agreement might have real value. Any comments folks have on 1) Edison's proposals and 2) whether it makes sense to continue discussions on Wednesday are appreciated.

I really need to get certified for diving and the diving there is extremely cheap, but reliable (its an American outfit and all PADI). PP thought she might be interested in going and doing it with me. So, first I wanted to know what you thought of the whole thing. Then, if you are into it at all I will look into flight opportunities (staying down there and the scuba course and single dives are all very cheap, but the flight would be the most expensive). And, last, do you have miles on continental and are they miles that PP can take advantage of also? I think Continental goes to San Salvador which is a common connecting city. So, you might luck out on flight costs and the whole trip would not be too bad. What do you think?

Question 1: Please explain the following line from your note: ""I really need to get certified for diving."" Question 2: How hot is it down there? Question 3: Cheap is good, but if you're going to travel that far to dive, is the diving good there, or is there another place (like Beliz) where the diving is supposed to be killer? -----Original Message----- From: Cameron Sellers [mailto:cameron@perfect.com] Sent: Wednesday, October 17, 2001 7:24 PM To: Dasovich, Jeff; 'PP' Subject: honduras I asked PP if she was interested in going to Honduras between xmas and new years this year. I really need to get certified for diving and the diving there is extremely cheap, but reliable (its an American outfit and all PADI). PP thought she might be interested in going and doing it with me. So, first I wanted to know what you thought of the whole thing. Then, if you are into it at all I will look into flight opportunities (staying down there and the scuba course and single dives are all very cheap, but the flight would be the most expensive). And, last, do you have miles on continental and are they miles that PP can take advantage of also? I think Continental goes to San Salvador which is a common connecting city. So, you might luck out on flight costs and the whole trip would not be too bad. What do you think?

The overall result is to reduce the capital revenue requirement by $24.8 million and expenses by $37.3 million. In addition, some portion of PG&E' estimated $171 million in electric distribution capital spending will be subject to rehearing. Listed below are the areas in which the Commission granted rehearing. 1. Electric Distribution Capital Spending. The Commission will, in essence, reopen the record, and allow PG&E to put into evidence how much it invested in its electric distribution plant in 1998. PG&E had used a 1998 forecasted amt of capital expenditures to develop its test year forecast. TURN argued that there was substantial evidence on the record that this amount was never spent. PG&E argued that the record closed prior to the end of 1998 so the best it could do was an estimate. On rehearing, the Commission agreed with TURN, that there was evidence that the forecasted amount was never spent, so they are allowing PG&E to prove it. The rehearing order states that any rates that are raised based on the electric distribution capital forecast adopted the GRC decision may be subject to refund. 2. Emergency Response Work This work category under electric distribution capital spending was reduced by $17.2 million. 3. Vegetation Management. The Supplemental Tree Trimming Program was reduced by $9.2 million. 4. Meter Reading. PG&E had primarily used accounting changes to justify the large increase in this service. On rehearing the Commission stated that PG&E had failed to substantiate those changes and reduced the allowed amount by $7.9 million. 5. Account Services. On rehearing the commission stated that PG&E had failed to show (a) why it cost so much more to provide services to CIA customers than residential customers ( $43.30 vs. $10.20); and (b) that money was not going for marketing activities that the Commission had disallowed in the previous GRC. The result was that the commission disallowed $20 million. 6. Customer Information Systems. The Commission disallowed $7.2 million as funds which ratepayers had already expended for CIS rewrites for which they had not received any benefits.",3027,congratulations. just more evidence that regulation moves with lightening speed!,"-----Original Message----- From: ""Petrochko, Mona L."" <Mona.L.Petrochko@ENRON.com>@ENRON Sent: Monday, October 22, 2001 1:52 PM To: JBennett; Jeff Dasovich (E-mail); Sue Mara (E-mail) Cc: mpetroch@enron.com; acomnes@enron.com Subject: RE: Rehearing on PG&E's GRC Vindication!

In addition, some portion of PG&E' estimated $171 million in electric distribution capital spending will be subject to rehearing. Listed below are the areas in which the Commission granted rehearing. 1. Electric Distribution Capital Spending. The Commission will, in essence, reopen the record, and allow PG&E to put into evidence how much it invested in its electric distribution plant in 1998. PG&E had used a 1998 forecasted amt of capital expenditures to develop its test year forecast. TURN argued that there was substantial evidence on the record that this amount was never spent. PG&E argued that the record closed prior to the end of 1998 so the best it could do was an estimate. On rehearing, the Commission agreed with TURN, that there was evidence that the forecasted amount was never spent, so they are allowing PG&E to prove it. The rehearing order states that any rates that are raised based on the electric distribution capital forecast adopted the GRC decision may be subject to refund. 2. Emergency Response Work This work category under electric distribution capital spending was reduced by $17.2 million. 3. Vegetation Management. The Supplemental Tree Trimming Program was reduced by $9.2 million. 4. Meter Reading. PG&E had primarily used accounting changes to justify the large increase in this service. On rehearing the Commission stated that PG&E had failed to substantiate those changes and reduced the allowed amount by $7.9 million. 5. Account Services. On rehearing the commission stated that PG&E had failed to show (a) why it cost so much more to provide services to CIA customers than residential customers ( $43.30 vs. $10.20); and (b) that money was not going for marketing activities that the Commission had disallowed in the previous GRC. The result was that the commission disallowed $20 million. 6. Customer Information Systems. The Commission disallowed $7.2 million as funds which ratepayers had already expended for CIS rewrites for which they had not received any benefits."

They've been working on it because they're not satisfied with the Governor's MOU with Edison. The Plan B group has been talking to a broad array of stakeholders, including Republicans, to get input into how ""Plan B"" can improve upon the MOU. First the good news about Plan B: a fairly bright group of legislators is rolling up its sleeves and attempting to come up with a centrist solution to the problem, and they're at least creating the appearance of trying to be bi-partison about it. (There is at least one idea in Plan B that is attributable to a Republican--Keith Richman--that Ken Lay met with a couple of weeks ago.) So the beginnings of a process to resolve California's crisis may be emerging. Now the bad news: because they are trying to build a consensus, Plan B is a mish-mash, isn't focused, includes some pretty bad ideas, excludes some good ideas (like re-establishing Direct Access immediately), and is going to require a lot more work to get right. Update on Efforts to Achieve a Settlement In the meeting with the suppliers that Steve Kean and I participated in yesterday, one of the financial consultants hired by the Governor criticized several of the Plan B proposals as unworkable. On today's call with the Governor's staff and suppliers it became somewhat apparent that the Governor isn't going drive a resolution, but will leave it to the Legislature to take the lead role. The staff emphasized repeatedly that the lawsuits, investigations, etc. were not on the table for discussion in any global settlement talks, and that attempting to bring them in to the negotiations was a nonstarter. Instead, the Governor's staff said that the group should focus on the size of the discount that suppliers would be willing to take. The suppliers pushed back, stating that including haircuts in the talks while excluding the lawsuits, investigations, etc. is one-sided and unworkable. The staff urged the group to begin negotiations with the Legislature, but made it fairly clear that the Governor would not be the one to pull the necessary principals together in a room to hammer out a solution; his staff implied instead that it's up to others, i.e., the suppliers, to get the process of negotiations underway. Next Steps If the Governor's financial consultants are prepared by Friday, they will brief suppliers on the ways in which the administration is attempting to resolve the State's creditworthiness issue to encourage suppliers to do power deals with CDWR. It they are not ready by Friday, the suppliers will meet separately to discuss next steps. Finally, there's been some confusion. My apologies.

Fielder wanted to talk about the negative CTC issue. Here's what he said: They plan to ""settle"" with the ESPs and pay them when they pay everyone else, which he re-iterated would be sometime in Q1'02. Edison is holding firm to the notion that the negative CTC contributed to the utility's undercollection and that the ESP's share of the undercollection has to be netted against the payables attributable to the negative CTC and owed the ESP. He said that they will propose to net it out in one of two ways: 1) lump sum netting (i.e., if they owe $50MM and the share of the undercollection is $30 MM, then they pay the ESP $20 MM; or 2) future reductions in PX Credit (i.e., they pay the ESP $50 MM, and then reduce the PX going forward until the $30 MM is paid down). The numbers are illustrative only. In addition, he said that they have the view that a decision is going to have to be made about 1) whether DA customers pay for stranded costs tied to the DWR L-T contracts, and 2) whether DA customers pay going forward for stranded costs tied to the QF contracts. (Edison is clearly lobbying the PUC to get DA customers to pay for these costs.) I recommended strongly that he de-link issues 1 and 2 above from the issue of paying us ASAP what they owe us for negative CTC. He agreed. He said that the PUC judge's recently issued pre-hearing conference order requires that Edison ""meet and confer"" with ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th hearing, and that Edison intends to set something up with ESPs prior to that hearing. Fielder is also the point person on ""getting ESPs paid"" and intends to initiate settlement discussions with ESPs week after next. It was very clear from the conversation that Edison is going to do everything possible (at the expense of creditors) to maximize headroom under the settlement it struck with the PUC a few weeks ago. Edison's stalemate with the QFs is evidence of it. We shouldn't assume anything different with the Negative CTC issue. If you have any questions, let us know.

Thanks. DJ Calif PUC Unlikely To Order Refunds From Pwr Generators Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. (This article was originally published Thursday) LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--The California Public Utilities Commission likely won't order generators to refund billions of dollars in windfall profits from last summer's wholesale power price spikes to utilities and customers, commissioners told Dow Jones Newswires Thursday. A Republican commissioner said the PUC knows generators are manipulating the wholesale power market in California but the commission doesn't have the ""expertise in-house to figure out who it is and how it's being done."" ""Even if we could force refunds, it would take five to 10 years in court to decide if generators should refund money,"" the commissioner said. ""I don't think the state is willing to spend the money or the time."" In addition, the commission is nowhere near deciding whether Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison and PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric can pass on a combined $5 billion in debt to their ratepayers, the commissioner said. A decision won't likely be made until mid-2001, the commissioner added. Only PUC President Loretta Lynch and Commissioner Carl Wood support having generators refund windfall profits to utilities and ratepayers. The commission's investigation, one of two ongoing probes into the state's troubled wholesale power market, has been unsuccessful in finding evidence that would force generators to refund billions of dollars, according to documents obtained Thursday by Dow Jones Newswires. Last week, federal regulators determined generators didn't manipulate the market. But they did find flaws in the state's market structure and said rates were ""unjust and unreasonable."" The state's Independent System Operator and Power Exchange have also concluded they have no evidence to prove generators manipulated the market in order to drive up wholesale power prices. The commissioner said the PUC doesn't support the utilities' efforts to pass on $5 billion in wholesale power costs to ratepayers. The commissioner said ""if it came down to deciding tomorrow, the utilities would be left holding the bag."" PG&E and SoCal Edison pay about 16 cents a kilowatt-hour for wholesale power. But the utilities charge their customers far less under a state-mandated rate freeze. As reported earlier Thursday, SoCal Edison President and Chief Executive Officer Stephen Frank said the utility's inability to immediately recover more than $2 billion in debt from its ratepayers may force the company to lay off employees and reduce major capital spending. PG&E filed a lawsuit in federal court Wednesday asking a judge to allow the utility to pass on $3 billion in debt to its customers. -By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874; mailto:jason.leopold@dowjones.com (END) Dow Jones Newswires 10-11-00",5536,"Keep in mind that there will be 3 Davis appointees come the first of the year.

Although we have prevailed (at least for now) on the issue ofr etroactivity, the decision still violates various provisions of state andf ederal law. If any party wishes to preserve the right to legally challenge this decision, it must file an application for rehearing within ten days. The attached draft is tentatively dated September 28, meaning that it would be filed next Friday. The primary reasons cited for why rehearing should be granted are asf ollows: The Decision violates procedural due process guarantees. The failure to hold hearings violates Public Utilities Code section 1708.5(f). The Commission's reliance on material outside the record violates due process. The Decision violates the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. The threatened retroactivity is contrary to law and in excess of the Commission's authority. The Commission acted contrary to law and in excess of its authority. The Decision's purported findings are not supported. The Commission has impermissibly converted a ratemaking proceeding into a quasi-legislative proceeding.

Although we have prevailed (at least for now) on the issue ofr etroactivity, the decision still violates various provisions of state andf ederal law. If any party wishes to preserve the right to legally challenge this decision, it must file an application for rehearing within ten days. The attached draft is tentatively dated September 28, meaning that it would be filed next Friday. The primary reasons cited for why rehearing should be granted are asf ollows: The Decision violates procedural due process guarantees. The failure to hold hearings violates Public Utilities Code section 1708.5(f). The Commission's reliance on material outside the record violates due process. The Decision violates the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. The threatened retroactivity is contrary to law and in excess of the Commission's authority. The Commission acted contrary to law and in excess of its authority. The Decision's purported findings are not supported. The Commission has impermissibly converted a ratemaking proceeding into a quasi-legislative proceeding.

How do they define the ""ESP's share of the undercollection?"" -----Original Message----- From: Dasovich, Jeff Sent: Tuesday, October 23, 2001 3:02 PM To: Shapiro, Richard; Steffes, James D.; Mellencamp, Lisa; Tribolet, Michael; Sanders, Richard B.; Kean, Steven J.; Sharp, Vicki; Smith, Mike; Williams, Robert C.; Curry, Wanda; Swain, Steve; Huddleson, Diann; Calger, Christopher F.; Belden, Tim; Dietrich, Janet Subject: Conversation with Edison re: Getting Negative CTC Paid I talked to John Fielder (SVP Edison) about setting up a meeting for Barry Tycholiz with Edison's CFO about hedging Edison's QF price risk. Fielder wanted to talk about the negative CTC issue. Here's what he said: They plan to ""settle"" with the ESPs and pay them when they pay everyone else, which he re-iterated would be sometime in Q1'02. Edison is holding firm to the notion that the negative CTC contributed to the utility's undercollection and that the ESP's share of the undercollection has to be netted against the payables attributable to the negative CTC and owed the ESP. He said that they will propose to net it out in one of two ways: 1) lump sum netting (i.e., if they owe $50MM and the share of the undercollection is $30 MM, then they pay the ESP $20 MM; or 2) future reductions in PX Credit (i.e., they pay the ESP $50 MM, and then reduce the PX going forward until the $30 MM is paid down). The numbers are illustrative only. In addition, he said that they have the view that a decision is going to have to be made about 1) whether DA customers pay for stranded costs tied to the DWR L-T contracts, and 2) whether DA customers pay going forward for stranded costs tied to the QF contracts. (Edison is clearly lobbying the PUC to get DA customers to pay for these costs.) I recommended strongly that he de-link issues 1 and 2 above from the issue of paying us ASAP what they owe us for negative CTC. He agreed. He said that the PUC judge's recently issued pre-hearing conference order requires that Edison ""meet and confer"" with ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th hearing, and that Edison intends to set something up with ESPs prior to that hearing.

How do they define the ""ESP's share of the undercollection?"" -----Original Message----- From: Dasovich, Jeff Sent: Tuesday, October 23, 2001 3:02 PM To: Shapiro, Richard; Steffes, James D.; Mellencamp, Lisa; Tribolet, Michael; Sanders, Richard B.; Kean, Steven J.; Sharp, Vicki; Smith, Mike; Williams, Robert C.; Curry, Wanda; Swain, Steve; Huddleson, Diann; Calger, Christopher F.; Belden, Tim; Dietrich, Janet Subject: Conversation with Edison re: Getting Negative CTC Paid I talked to John Fielder (SVP Edison) about setting up a meeting for Barry Tycholiz with Edison's CFO about hedging Edison's QF price risk. Fielder wanted to talk about the negative CTC issue. Here's what he said: They plan to ""settle"" with the ESPs and pay them when they pay everyone else, which he re-iterated would be sometime in Q1'02. Edison is holding firm to the notion that the negative CTC contributed to the utility's undercollection and that the ESP's share of the undercollection has to be netted against the payables attributable to the negative CTC and owed the ESP. He said that they will propose to net it out in one of two ways: 1) lump sum netting (i.e., if they owe $50MM and the share of the undercollection is $30 MM, then they pay the ESP $20 MM; or 2) future reductions in PX Credit (i.e., they pay the ESP $50 MM, and then reduce the PX going forward until the $30 MM is paid down). The numbers are illustrative only. In addition, he said that they have the view that a decision is going to have to be made about 1) whether DA customers pay for stranded costs tied to the DWR L-T contracts, and 2) whether DA customers pay going forward for stranded costs tied to the QF contracts. (Edison is clearly lobbying the PUC to get DA customers to pay for these costs.) I recommended strongly that he de-link issues 1 and 2 above from the issue of paying us ASAP what they owe us for negative CTC. He agreed. He said that the PUC judge's recently issued pre-hearing conference order requires that Edison ""meet and confer"" with ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th hearing, and that Edison intends to set something up with ESPs prior to that hearing. Fielder is also the point person on ""getting ESPs paid"" and intends to initiate settlement discussions with ESPs week after next. It was very clear from the conversation that Edison is going to do everything possible (at the expense of creditors) to maximize headroom under the settlement it struck with the PUC a few weeks ago. Edison's stalemate with the QFs is evidence of it. We shouldn't assume anything different with the Negative CTC issue. If you have any questions, let us know. Best, Jeff"

We are in the process of extending the term of some of our existing CA deals that we executed on the Master in June. Understanding that ""new"" deals struck after 9/20 are, and extensions of existing deals may be, at risk, it seems to me we have three basic options in order to effect this extension, and I want to make sure we evaluate and choose the one that minimizes the risk that the extension is invalidated. Note that DASR's have been submitted for the subject accounts under the original Transactions. The 3 choices I see are: 1. .Amend and Restate the existing Transaction Confirmation to add the extension and new price for the extension. In this case, the extension would be wrapped up on one document that is signed after 9/20 but effective in June. 2. Simply amend the existing Transaction to add extended term and price. This would be a separate document. 3. Execute a whole new Transaction for the extended term, which would be effective when signed but the services and price under which would not start until after the expiration of the existing Transaction. The existing Transaction would stay in tact as written. It seems to me that choice number 3 is the safest overall. The amended and restated route has appeal because the whole transaction is dated back to June. However, if a regulator were to peel it back, the conclusion could be that the deal was struck after Sept 20 and therefore the whole transaction was invalid, including the original structure. I think that choice 2, though creating a separate document for the extension, could fall into the same trap. In that sense, choice 3 seems safest because arguably the original transaction is not at risk. If the extension is invalidated, that determination would likely not claw back to the original deal.

California Lawmakers Vote to Limit Power Costs By Rebecca Smith 09/01/2000 The Wall Street Journal Page A4 (Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) California lawmakers voted to extend modest relief to San Diego residents burdened with high electricity bills and set the groundwork for faster construction of badly needed power plants. They stopped short, however, of passing legislation that would roll back retail power rates to levels seen prior to deregulation . Late Wednesday, lawmakers sent a bill to Gov. Gray Davis that limits to 6.5 cents per kilowatt hour the amount that small customers of San Diego Gas & Electric Co. can be charged. The utility is allowed to add power-delivery and other reasonable costs to that commodity price. The price, equivalent to a bulk power cost of $65 per megawatt hour, is far higher than the average price of power for 27 of the 31 months in which California's market has been deregulated. But in June and July, the average price of power obtained by the utility from a state-sanctioned energy auction rose to 12 cents and 10.5 cents, respectively, compared with the 2.3 cents and 2.8 cents charged in those months a year earlier. Passed directly through to customers,the resulting bills sparked a near mutiny. The rate-cap measure applies to residential and small commercial customers, as well as to schools and hospitals. In addition to the rate cap, which can be adjusted upward or downward by the California Public Utilities Commission until December 2002, the legislature earmarked $150 million of general-fund revenue, which can be used to subsidize San Diego power costs if they greatly exceed the 6.5-cents-per-kilowatt-hour rate. For now, the utility would be expected to make up any difference between revenue collected and the actual cost. Steve Baum, chairman of Sempra Energy, parent of San Diego Gas & Electric Co., said the rate-cap measure is ""deeply flawed"" because it limits the amount prices can rise but sets no floor. That means any shortfall could grow -- without a mechanism for customers to pay it down -- until the end of the rate-cap period, which could last until December 2002 or December 2003. Mr. Baum said Sempra stands to suffer an undercollection of perhaps $664 million, provided future prices approximate the New York Mercantile Exchange forward prices through December 2002. ""It's irreparably damaging to Sempra,"" he said because it ""creates tremendous uncertainty"" that makes it hard for the San Diego energy company to finance new projects such as a new transmission line. The legislature also appeared likely to approve a bill speeding up the permit process for the construction of new power plants, in part by beefing up staffs of regulatory agencies that review the plans.

If yes, Joseph has come up with a couple of very fun ideas for an activity but suggestions are greatly encouraged and welcome. Same goes for a restaurant (understanding that the choice of activity may influence where we eat). Sue has put in her vote for Fleur de Lys. Should we try to organize the event with the rest of the SF office (i.e., EES and ENA) or confine it to GA? Should we expand to include Western GA or keep it to SFGA? We choose for dates the 7th or 8th or 14th or 15th of December. What's your preference. Is there a day that just won't work? Joseph, if I've missed anything, please tack on.

It would also maker the event very BIG -- so I'd be more happy with just GA - but I can go either way. We should include Marcie, Paul, Carl, Roger and Peter and families -- if they want to come School nights are bad -- even without kids -- so the 7th doesn't work.

Sarita Sarvate of the CPUC spoke to the woman in person. The school in question is the Providence High School in Burbank, California (not Ontario), operated by the Sisters of Providence. Ms. Kathy Pentalio (sp?) at 818-846-8140 wrote to the CPUC asking about the school's options after receiving phone and letter notification that their gas service would be terminated by Enron. Apparently the Sisters also operate a hospital which is also served by Enron. Ms. Pentalio indicated that she was told that the school would no longer be served on the same contract as the hospital (claimed to be an attractive 86 cents/th rate) because the school's load was so small that it was a core customer, while the hospital was a noncore customer with a larger load. Neither Ms. Sarvate nor Ms. Pentalio was clear if the school was served as a core aggregation customer or as part of the Sisters of Providence noncore contract. Ms. Pentalio claimed she spoke with Enron employees Dennis Harris in Dublin, Ohio as well as Roger Pons in New Mexico. She indicated that service would be terminated on June 1, 2001 and she is looking for alternative sources of gas. Sarita Sarvate of the CPUC Energy Division would like to understand the specifics of this case, but her main concern, and the purpose for sending a letter (if she does send one) is that Dynergy has told her that a number of small noncore businesses are being returned to the utilities by marketers because they no longer meet credit requirements. She assumed that must be true with Enron as well. I indicated to her that she should never assume that we are doing what Dynegy is doing and that we would respond and advise her if there was any significant trend of noncore customer turnbacks. The Commission's concern, which I know you understand, is that it is phasing out the core subscription schedule (and has a moratorium on switches to the SoCalGas core subscription schedule) therefore leaving no place for such customers to go if they cannot contract with a replacement aggregator.

After a brief description of major provisions of the MOU, questions were taken. Following is a summary of that call. Major Components of Plan (repeatedly referred to as the ""Governor's Plan"") Maintains cost-of-service treatment for utility retained generation for 10 years Sale of transmission assets (or other assets) to CDWR Dedication of the ""Sunrise"" generation project to cost-of-service based rates for 10 years ($2 mm penalty if not on-line by August) Provision of easements and potential conveyances in fee of certain lands (at two hydro projects) Provides for full recovery of $3.5 B utility net underrecovery as of 1/31/01 Commits SCE to spend $3 B in capital expenditures over 5 years Dismissal of federal lawsuits by SCE SCE will resume traditional utility procurement obligations by 1/1/03, assuming CDWR contracts and entering into new purchase contracts as necessary It was stressed that the MOU was a comprehensive plan to be treated as an integrated package. While the CPUC and members of the legislature were involved in various stages of the negotiation, the agreement is technically between SCE and CDWR. Various regulatory and legislative approvals are necessary for implementation of the MOU. SCE has rights to terminate the MOU if the CPUC has not adopted specified ""implementing decisions"" within 60 days. Legislation necessary to implement certain provisions of the MOU must be passed by August 15. For ratemaking purposes the CPUC will grant SCE a 11.6% ROE on its generation and distribution rate base. Questions and Answers What was expected timing of return to investment grade for SCE? Up to the rating agencies. Many steps to go through. It is assumed agencies will be following closely but timing is uncertain. Would have to be before utility resumes power procurement obligations. Applicability of 11.6% ROE? ROE would increase from current 7% ROE to level no less than 11.6% for both generation and distribution assets on unamortized balance at 12/31/00 and capital structure roughly at 50/50. Potential for write-offs? While plan calls for full recovery of net undercollections as of 1/31/01, because of timing issues SCE may take a write-off then have a ""write-up"" at a later date. Interest in how/why/impact of inclusion of Mission Sunrise generation project (investor concern over market v. regulated returns)? The state was looking at all options for long-term power contracts. Market returns traded for security of long-term contract. What will be source for $3 b capital investments over next 5 years? Capital would come from retained earnings, borrowing and additional investments from holding company. Concern over ability of existing rate level (and ""waterfall"" disbursement) to recover all costs especially if CDWR procurement costs increase? Existing rates should cover all costs. Provisions in MOU allow adjustment to rates to maintain investment grade status. What was gained from MOU as opposed to pursuit through the courts? Speed and certainty with respect to resolution of outstanding issues. Will the sale be a taxable event? Yes. What is the URG unit cost? $.042 per kwH.

Enron would be one of the largest unsecured creditors in the event of a PG&E bankruptcy; our claim may become even larger depending on the extent to which we acquire additional claims against the utilities through the PX or ISO. We are therefore interested in any action that would reduce the pool of assets available to unsecured creditors. 2. This proposal may be to our benefit, or to our detriment. There is not a great deal of detail in the proposal currently on the table, and Enron needs additional information in order to evaluate the proposal. Certainly, we need to evaluate this in light of other developments. 3. The proposal contemplates pledging ""existing and future"" receivables to secure obligations owed to gas suppliers; PGE shows approx. $1.3 billion in A/R as of 9/30; will that (or an amount of like magnitude) be pledged as security under this plan? Granting gas suppliers security may be fine with us, but we don't have a great interest in OVER-collateralizing their positions. More current information on the current A/R balances and the extent to which obligations to suppliers will be secured will be helpful. 4. Do they intend to extend this security to ALL gas suppliers, or only those that are refusing to supply PGE under current circumstances? 5. Do they intend to secure obligations on a going-forward basis only, or will they also secure their obligations with respect to payables that have already accrued? 6. PG&E is scheduled to make a couple of large payments to ENE tomorrow; what is PG&E's ability to make those payments for gas already delivered? 7. Given the extension of the DOE order, it seems that consideration of this petition could be delayed for a few days to allow interested parties sufficient time to evaluate its implications. Give me a call with any questions. In light of the DOE extension of the emergency gas supply order, there should now be adequate time for PG&E to respond to these points and clarify their proposal.

(PS, NE); jstewart; kmccrea; mkahl; vjw; wbooth; mkahl Subject: Angelides Trying to Turn Up Heat on Loretta Calif. power bond delay may lead to large deficit NEW YORK, Sept 27 (Reuters) - California state Treasurer Philip Angelides said Thursday the state could face a $9.3 billion budget deficit in the 2002-2003 fiscal year if $12.5 billion of power bonds are not sold before July 2002. The treasurer is certain the bonds will be sold, but he released the figures in an attempt to pressure the California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) into actions it must take in order to sell the bonds. ""What I am concerned about is the fact this law has not been effectuated eight months after it was passed,"" Angelides said in a telephone news conference in Sacramento, referring to a law passed in February setting the biggest municipal bond sale ever in motion. The state depleted its general fund by at least $6.2 billion buying electricity to keep power flowing and must sell the bonds in order to refill the state's general fund and make future power purchases. ""There can be no schedule (for the bond sale) until the PUC completes its work,"" Angelides said. Earlier this week the PUC said the much-delayed meeting is now set for Oct. 2. Angelides said PUC Commissioner Jeff Brown, one of five, is on board to make the vote, but President Loretta Lynch and other commissioners, ""are not ready to act."" Lynch said earlier this week that she wants more time to work out details with Angelides and the Department of Water Resources concerning the money and terms of the rate order and rate agreement. How the money from rate increases approved in May will be split up to pay for the bonds and to reimburse troubled power utilities and giving the Department of Water Resources the authority to sell the bonds, still need to be decided by the PUC. Angelides is projecting a $3.1 billion budget deficit for the 2002-2003 fiscal year, even if the bonds are sold in time, due to reduced revenues as the overall U.S. economy slows. In a worst case scenario, Angelides added that with the bond sale, the $3.1 billion gap may grow to $4 billion, while a late sale would push the $9.3 billion number to $10.2 billion. The treasurer painted a dire picture of California 's budget if the bonds are not sold, likening it to the state's budget problems of the early 1990s. Angelides warned a 2 percent sales tax increase might have to be put in place, or possibly a $1,574 per student cut in state K-12 education spending. Or, the state could drop all spending on the University of California and California State University and save $6 billion. Eighteen percent of the state's non-education budget would need to be cut if the bonds are not sold, he said. ********************************************************************** This e-mail is the property of Enron Corp. and/or its relevant affiliate and may contain confidential and privileged material for the sole use of the intended recipient (s).

Apologies for any omissions, inaccuracies, etc. Others who were on the call please chime in if I've gotten anything wrong, or missed anything. Best, Jeff SUMMARY Enron, Duke, El Paso and Williams were on the call, as was Michael Hoffman of the Blackstone Group (the Governor's financial advisors). On the subject of how the group would organize itself, it was agreed that the calls would be open to anyone who wanted to participate. A smaller group consisting of Duke, El Paso, Enron, and Williams would take the lead on walking the halls of Sacramento, meeting with policy makers, and advocating whatever plan the group develops. Folks agreed that achieving a comprehesive solution requires a tangible process; that is, the principals need to get in a room, face to face, for however long it takes to work out a resolution. It was agreed that the process should start no later than the beginning of next week, and that it should take place in Sacramento. It was decided that the Legislature and the Attorney General needed to be brought into the process as soon as possible, i.e., next week. There was some discussion regarding the release today of ""Plan B."" Plan B is a plan proposed by Democratic and Republican legislators as an alternative to the MOU that the Governor struck with Edison. After that call I received a copy of ""Plan B."" If you'd like a copy please send me your fax number. Folks on the call agreed to have the next ""supplier-only"" call-in meeting on Friday. Finally, Michael Hoffman said that they are hoping to have a ""ratings agency level"" presentation prepared by the end of the week. The goal of the presentation is to reassure capital markets that the bonds the state seeks to issue are solidly backed by retail rates. The Agenda for Tomorrow's Call with the Governor's Staff Item #1: The Credit Issue Michael Hoffman said that the Governor's office wants to start tomorrow's meeting discussing the creditworthiness issue. Hoffman said that the Governor's folks are hoping to have completed by the start of tomorrow's meeting a draft of an agreement between the California PUC and CDWR. The agreement is designed to ensure that DWR gets paid for power services delivered. If the draft is ready, they'd like to discuss on the call tomorrow. Item #2: Identify the Components of a Comprehensive Solution. It was agreed that our group should put on the table at tomorrow's meeting the universe of issues that need to be included in a comprehensive solution. Enron was asked to take a first stab at what those components are. The following is a brief outline, which is not intended to be definitive, but a starting point for discussion. Utility creditworthiness retail rates must reflect costs Increase supply streamline and otherwise reform the siting process Decrease demand establish real-time pricing implement demand buy-down and other conservation programs Create a real market Remove the State from the power-buying business as soon as possible (e.g., once new rates are in place and utilities are returned to creditworthiness; approximately 3-6 months) Return the procurement role to the utilities Reinstate Direct Access immediately for all customers Within 18-24 months, create a ""core/noncore"" market structure for electricity, similar to California's market structure for natural gas Keep the industry in the hands of the private sector Reject proposals calling on the State to take over transmission, generation, etc. Resolve outstanding legal claims, investigations, etc. Resolution requires certainty and prompt payment (understanding that discounts on receivables is on the table for discussion)",4836,"No problem.

The Burton language looks cleaner and simpler, though there may be reasons to include some of the Hertzberg language, too. I'm proposing to the group the following as potential amendments to the bond bill. I would appreciate your feedback. The amendments would be as follows: Customers who were on Direct Access when DWR started buying power (Jan. 17th?), and are still on Direct Access when the bill passes, should be exempt from paying for the bonds. In short, customers should not be forced to pay for power twice--once from their ESP, and once from DWR. Since these customers receive power services from their ESP, they never consumed DWR power in the first place and it wouldn't be fair to require them to pay for it. Customers who have been utility customers since DWR started buying power but subsequently switched to Direct Access should only pay for power provided by DWR that they actually consumed, no more and no less. For example, if a customer was a utility customer when DWR started buying power but switched to Direct Access on May 1st, then the customer would only be responsible for reimbursing DWR for power deliveries that took place from Jan. 17th thru April 30th. I believe that we agreed on these concepts during the negotiations that took place over the past 4-5 weeks. Or if we didn't explicitly agree during the talks, they seem to be principles on which we ought to be able to agree pretty easily now. And rather than leave the issue hanging, which can create unnecessary and costly uncertainty for customers, I suggest that we include very clear and simple legislative language in the bond bill clarifying what customers' obligations are. Your thoughts are appreciated. In addition, we have talked quite a bit about providing customers with incentives in the attempt to get California out of the energy hole that it finds itself in. Providing (20KW and above) customers with an incentive to switch to Direct Access as soon as possible could 1) reduce the net short position that the state (and ultimately consumers) have to finance, thereby reducing spot purchases and price volatility, 2) reduce electricity purchasing costs, and 3) reduce the burden on the state budget. With this in mind, I'm also proposing that the group consider an amendment to the bond bill that would exempt from bond charges any customer that switches to Direct Access by September 1st. Finally, it seems odd that the language directing the PUC to suspend Direct Access is still in the bill. If a dedicated rate component is created, that seems to eliminate altogether the need to suspend Direct Access. And if that's the case, would it make sense to delete that language from the bill?

I made a couple of matches where it seemed there was some kind of similarity in background or career, but for the most part, the assignments were essentially random. The list includes names, phones at home and work, company and title. Remember these are newly admitted students who have not yet accepted our offer of admission. The deadline to accept this offer is April 27th. A general outline of the phone call, should you choose to use it, would be: 1) Congratulations on being admitted to the Haas School 2) indentify yourself as ""involved with the student government at the Haas School, and the evening office asked me to give you a call to see if you had any questions about the program. Then answer the questions, if you can, or refer them to me or Ken for further follow-up 3)describe your own experience at school and how it has worked with your career--timing, advancement, scheduling, tuition payments, etc. 4)invite them to attend a class so we can show them around. EMBA office will coordinate. 5)remind them of the ""New Students Admit Reception"" on April 19th from 7-9 in the Wells Fargo Room (drinks and hors d'oeuvres served). (Refer to Diane's recent email for other particulars. Some pieces of information you might want to have handy -required new student orientation is August 11-12; classes start on the 13th -fees will be $1580 per unit; 42 units required, including the two units for MPAR -orientation packages will be sent out mid-June -administration will call each new student in July with class schedules -second round of admits come out in early June Thanks very much for helping.

I made a couple of matches where it seemed there was some kind of similarity in background or career, but for the most part, the assignments were essentially random. The list includes names, phones at home and work, company and title. Remember these are newly admitted students who have not yet accepted our offer of admission. The deadline to accept this offer is April 27th. A general outline of the phone call, should you choose to use it, would be: 1) Congratulations on being admitted to the Haas School 2) indentify yourself as ""involved with the student government at the Haas School, and the evening office asked me to give you a call to see if you had any questions about the program. Then answer the questions, if you can, or refer them to me or Ken for further follow-up 3)describe your own experience at school and how it has worked with your career--timing, advancement, scheduling, tuition payments, etc. 4)invite them to attend a class so we can show them around. EMBA office will coordinate. 5)remind them of the ""New Students Admit Reception"" on April 19th from 7-9 in the Wells Fargo Room (drinks and hors d'oeuvres served). (Refer to Diane's recent email for other particulars. Some pieces of information you might want to have handy -required new student orientation is August 11-12; classes start on the 13th -fees will be $1580 per unit; 42 units required, including the two units for MPAR -orientation packages will be sent out mid-June -administration will call each new student in July with class schedules -second round of admits come out in early June Thanks very much for helping. Let me know if there is anything else you may need or could suggest to help in this effort. Joseph Tambornino __________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!?

Sue seemed more concerned about having a call at all then on the time. If she expressed a view that the time was set up so that she couldn't be on the call, I'd like to discuss, since that didn't factor in at all. As you know, having gone through Sandi, I'm extremely sensitive to inter-group relations. If you feel there are issues that we should discuss, I'd really like to do it. I react very strongly to any view that I am intentionally doing anything to get in Sue's---or others---way. From my perspective, I feel strongly that I haven't behaved that way, and don't in any way intend to. I simply have no desire to ""compete"" with colleagues, Sue in particular. There aren't enough people to do all the work, and there's plenty of tasks, recognition, blame, etc. to go around. These are extremely challenging times and we won't get anywhere unless it's truly a team effort. I know that the SF office has a history of challenges with respect to California leadership. I have no interest in returning to the very un-teamlike atmosphere that existed previously, particularly since the atmosphere has changed so positively in the past few months.
