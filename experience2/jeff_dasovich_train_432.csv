These estimates are for Enron budgetary purposes only, and do not represent a commitment or a ""not to exceed"" figure for Goodin, MacBride. The actual fees incurred may exceed these estimates, and GMSRD will bill Enron on a hourly fee basis, as opposed to the retainer mechanism used in the first part of this year. 1. Direct access legislation: This involves working on a continuing series of bills related to direct access. I cannot estimate a specific amount for the entire legislative project, it depends on how long it takes for the legislature to enact significant direct access legislation. My best estimate is $8,000 per month, or $24,000 over three months. The estimate would increase if direct access is still at issue in the session's last month--August. As of May 11, 2001, we have recorded approximately $3000 in billings related to direct access in this month. 2. Improved powerplant siting and increased emission offset legislation: $15,000 over three months, more if the final legislative solution is delayed until August. We have recorded approximately $1,000 in billings related to this area this month (through May 11, 2001). 3. Windfall profits tax bill: This project required additional upfront legal research regarding the constitutionality of the proposed tax. We have billed legal fees for approximately $4000 in May, 2001, up through May 11. My best estimate is $18,000 over three months of session, more if the bill is still alive in August. 4. Global settlement/Edison MOU/Plan B legislation: This project covers the gamut of comprehensive legislative proposals to address the energy crisis, including a proposal by the Governor, legislation to approve the Edison MOU or an alternative plan which does not involve purchase of the Edison transmission system, commonly referred to as ""Plan B"". As explained by Paul Kaufman, this work is expected to involve less work in the near term, and more as the legislation actually moved forward in the future. Trying to average this increasing level of work over time is difficult, but I am estimating $15,000 over the next three months, more if the package is still being enacted in August. We have recorded approximately $2000 in billings on this issue through May 11, 2001 this month. Please contact me if you have any questions regarding any of the above.

We are trying to get folks who are dealing with the nuts and bolts issues, someone on the ground -- you get the idea - someone from Houston. Below are the details on the panel: Tuesday November 14th -- 1:30 p.m. - 3:00 p.m. Natural Gas Issues Issue: The future cost and availability of natural gas will become a dominant factor in the generation of electricity in California as more generation is built in future years. We have seen the natural gas price increase over 100% in the last fifteen months. Why has the price increased so dramatically? While the price increases can be expected to spur increased exploration and drilling, and this supply. Where can California expect to procure its natural gas supply and at what price over the next five to ten years? There are now some significant natural gas storage facilities coming on line - will they help hedge future price volatility? Are independent, unregulated generators concerned about our natural gas future? Who are the largest competitors to California for natural gas supply and what will be the role of new technology in increasing capture of new supply? Moderator: Keith McCrea Suggested Panelists: ____________, California Energy Commission (Fuels planner) ____________, El Paso Energy Corporation (Pipeline representative) ____________, Fuels Procurement, Calpine ____________, Enron ____________, Gas Storage Representative Ed Yates, CA League of Food Processors (customer perspective) Can you get back to me and let me know if and who could participate from Enron?

We are trying to get folks who are dealing with the nuts and bolts issues, someone on the ground -- you get the idea - someone from Houston. Below are the details on the panel: Tuesday November 14th -- 1:30 p.m. - 3:00 p.m. Natural Gas Issues Issue: The future cost and availability of natural gas will become a dominant factor in the generation of electricity in California as more generation is built in future years. We have seen the natural gas price increase over 100% in the last fifteen months. Why has the price increased so dramatically? While the price increases can be expected to spur increased exploration and drilling, and this supply. Where can California expect to procure its natural gas supply and at what price over the next five to ten years? There are now some significant natural gas storage facilities coming on line - will they help hedge future price volatility? Are independent, unregulated generators concerned about our natural gas future? Who are the largest competitors to California for natural gas supply and what will be the role of new technology in increasing capture of new supply? Moderator: Keith McCrea Suggested Panelists: ____________, California Energy Commission (Fuels planner) ____________, El Paso Energy Corporation (Pipeline representative) ____________, Fuels Procurement, Calpine ____________, Enron ____________, Gas Storage Representative Ed Yates, CA League of Food Processors (customer perspective) Can you get back to me and let me know if and who could participate from Enron? Thanks for your help. Delaney P.S. You better be planning to attend this year -- at least the day sessions! :-)"

We met with Edison yesterday in the attempt to settle our negative CTC claim. ? Edison continues to take a very hard-line, extreme position. This is it in a nutshell: 1. all customers--bundled and DA alike--""contributed to Edison's undercollection"" and all customers must pay it down; 2. bundled customers contributed through frozen rates and DA customers contributed through the negative CTC; 3. Edison says it will pay ESPs past due amounts related to the negative CTC, but it intends to then turn around and assess a charge on all customer bills--DA and bundled alike--to recover its undercollection. 4. Edison intends to collect it over approximately 2 years. Edison estimates that the charge to DA customers over this period would be about $25-27/MWH. 5. Under Edison's plan, Enron would likely end up paying Edison, i.e., the present value of the ""undercollection"" charge would exceed the present value of the lump sum negative CTC payment. ? Obviously, with respect to any settlement with Edison, we're extremely far apart and we're therefore considering other options. ?

It would be an understatement to say that the last year's worth events have been amazing at best. As we discussed at lunch, Enron has developed a unique approach to QF contract restructuring. The main premise is that of conducting a dual auction to determine, on a completely voluntary and open process, the QF buyout economics and the market clearing price for replacement energy. As discussed yesterday, I am enclosing copies of the presentations made to PG&E and SCE on this topic. I would be very interested in your feedback on this concept and on the presentations provided. I must footnote that the economic shown in the presentations are Enron estimates. Individual feedback, particularly in this area would be appreciated. Jeff Dasovitch out of our SF office has been working with me on this proposal and will likely be contacting you within the next day to further discuss this idea as well as the benefits and possible strategies for initiating such an auction process.

Jeff Dasovitch out of our SF office has been working with me on this proposal and will likely be contacting you within the next day to further discuss this idea as well as the benefits and possible strategies for initiating such an auction process. Thanks for your time and look forward to hearing from you.

The electric service providers and customers who are parties shall w= ork with other parties and shall jointly submit a proposed protective order= and nondisclosure agreement that will cover parties other than Commission = staff by December 11, 2001. 4. Parties' supplemental comments to the comments they filed in respons= e to the October 23rd Assigned Commissioner Ruling shall be submitted by Ja= nuary 4, 2002. As a preliminary matter, of course, AReM and WPTF do not, in their own name= s, have direct access contracts.

	smara@enron.com, jdasovic@enron.com","Good draft. Few comments: * As much as we may not like it, the commission is where the action is right now, and we're going to have to work with them. As such, I think the comments would be significantly more effective if you go through the document and edit out the invective and other highly charged adjectives, which, while therapeutic, tend to incent the Commission to ignore or be even more hostile to our interests. In short, I don't see an upside to it and there is downside. Rather than try to edit, I've simply compiled those paragraphs that in my view should be deleted or require serious toning-down. In addition to these specific areas, I would recommend going through the document and toning it down generally. * Seems that it would be useful, up front and at the end, to give OUR answer (maybe I'm repeating Jim's comments here): e.g., The Commission should 1) not do retroactive, 2) permit customers to do what the contracts permit (e.g., add facilities, renew, etc.), 3) hold hearings on all of Wood's unsubstantiated assertions, and 4) anything else we want to be part of the solution as it relates to the issues raised by Karl. * On page 2, do we run the risk of affirming what Angelides and others are saying, i.e., that DA could bankrupt the state? Sure we need to say it, since it seems to play into their spin and everyone already knows of the bind they're in? Could backfire. * Point # 6 on page 14: are we inviting the Commission to ask parties to submit contracts? Possible to re-write or eliminate this so that it doesn't appear we're advocating having folks submit them? Good job. Thanks for your efforts.

Until the next legislative session starts up, the call will be optional for the gang in Sacramento. If you have any alternative suggestions, questions, and/or comments, please let me know. And please forward to others who need/would like to know. Best, Jeff"

After reviewing your presentation, here are some tough questions that we can discuss tomorrow: 1. Would the replacement energy from the market be obtained under contracts of similar length and firmness as the QF contracts that the energy replaces? If not, why would the CPUC want to replace long-term, committed QF power with short-term firm energy? WOULDN'T HAVE TO, BUT PRESUMABLY THE REPLACEMENT POWER WOULD BE CONSIDERABLY MORE ""DISPATCHABLE."" 2. Why would the CPUC want to replace long-term QF power over which it has substantial regulatory leverage (through SRAC pricing) with market energy from sources over which it may have less control? PRICES WOULD BE FIRM AND WOULD REDUCE POWER COSTS TO CONSUMERS SUBSTANTIALLY AND AVOID THE PROTRACTED, COSTLY LITIGATION THAT GOES ON INCESSANTLY BETWEEN EDISON AND QFS. (AND WOULD AVOID ALMOST LOSING THE QFS BASED ON CONTINUED NEGATIVE ACTIONS BY EDISON.) IN SHORT, ENDING THE HOLY WARS IS A GOOD THING. 3. Are there 8,000 MWs of low-cost replacement energy available in California, or in the WSCC with firm transmission to California? How steep is the supply curve for replacement energy? FORECASTS SHOW ONE HELLUVALOT OF POWER COMING ON LINE. HOWEVER, IF THERE WERE CONCERNS, THE MWS COULD BE CAPPED. 4. After a QF is bought out, I assume that it would simply operate in the electric market as a merchant plant, if it continues to operate to provide on-site power and thermal energy. Is this correct? YES. 5. How sensitive are your calculated ratepayer and QF benefits to changes in the relationship between SRAC (i.e. gas) and electric market prices? OBVIOUSLY, VERY CONNECTED. 6. Assuming that there are both ratepayer and QF benefits from QF contract buyouts, why is there a need for a formalized auction process, when the same benefits might be captured through bilateral negotiations (such as the QF buyouts done to date)? BILATERAL NEGOTIATIONS DO NOT EXIST. THEY ARE A MYTH. THIS TRIES TO GET AROUND THAT IMPASSE. 7. Doesn't your proposal require the utilities to be back in the power procurement business? If not, why not? THAT'S A GOOD THING. AND NO MORE THAN THEY WOULD BE OVER THE LIFE OF THE QF CONTRACTS. As you perhaps can tell, my questions focus on whether now is the right time for such a broad plan to buyout QF contracts. THERE ARE ALWAYS REASONS TO CONCLUDE THAT NOW IS NOT THE RIGHT TIME. ON THE OTHER HAND, THERE'S NO TIME LIKE THE PRESENT. AND IF A QF HAS THE OPTION OF 1) RECEIVING THE NPV OF THE QF AND 2) RETAINING CONTROL OF THE ASSET, I'VE STRUGGLED MIGHTILY TRYING TO FIND A DOWNSIDE FOR THE QF. LOOK FORWARD TO TALKING TOMORROW.

I ran across Perfect when I was doing an MBA project--we were required to find a company that we could consult to on e-commerce strategy. I've since found out that Perfect's doing a pilot with EES--acting as the e-procurment platform for products tied to EES' outsourcing deals. From what I hear it's going well, and EES is enthusiastic. The technology is very interesting: soup to nuts e-procurement platform developed by Paul Milgrom (global auction guru and economist at Stanford). Glad you guys can meet with them.

Congratulations on your new role. Sounds exciting (in addition to exhausting). Based on our call, I contacted Perfect Commerce. The two folks from their shop that will be in Houston are: Ian Sullivan SVP, Professional Services and all implementation of the product Cameron Sellers VP, Business Development They'd like to meet sometime during the week of October 15th. Let me know if that works for you and Brad. Or if you'd like to contact them directly, just let me know and I'll get you their numbers/emails. I ran across Perfect when I was doing an MBA project--we were required to find a company that we could consult to on e-commerce strategy. I've since found out that Perfect's doing a pilot with EES--acting as the e-procurment platform for products tied to EES' outsourcing deals. From what I hear it's going well, and EES is enthusiastic. The technology is very interesting: soup to nuts e-procurement platform developed by Paul Milgrom (global auction guru and economist at Stanford). Glad you guys can meet with them. I think it's definitely worth the time--the technology may fit very well with Networks.

(PR) Subject: Colorful Dissent from Two PUC Commissioners Opposed to Suspending DA Commissioners Henry M. Duque and Richard A. Bilas, dissenting: One could say that this order is consistent with the Administration's present third world country mentality. We are punishing the very consumers and providers who made a commitment to ensuring electric restructuring did work by adding a demand retail component to cure the dysfunctions in the wholesale market. We are not convinced that the Department of Water Resources (DWR) bond ratings depend on killing direct access. This notion is a scare tactic and a smoke screen. Direct access comprises such a small percentage of overall demand that it cannot reasonably be seen to be a threat to the sale of the bonds. Direct Access should be seen as a benefit to DWR. It would decrease the amount of the utilities net short obligations and relieve DWR from its power purchasing responsibilities sooner. Something else is going on here. We think that the DWR does not want direct access because if the public is presented with alternatives, it will make DWR's purchasing mistakes abundantly clear. The Commission should be holding hearings to test the assertions being made by DWR, Finance and the Treasurer. Instead, the Commission is making an ill informed, panicked decision to act now and study the repercussions later. DWR and the bonds should not be threatened by direct access if DWR is making prudent energy purchases. Only if DWR's contracts are too expensive, relative to market, will customers seek shelter in lower direct access prices. Indeed, retaining direct access as a way to send price signals to consumers may be the only way to place pressure on DWR to make more prudent purchases. This is a very important consideration since AB 1X prevents us from engaging in any prudency review of the DWR costs to be passed through to ratepayers in order to repay the bonds. If there is no yardstick, how can anyone measure DWR performance? The answer is, one can't, unless SB 18xx is signed into law. We think that additional review of these issues, before suspending direct access, would have produced a more sound decision in the long run. For these reasons we must respectfully dissent. /s/ HENRY M. DUQUE /s/ RICHARD A. BILAS Henry M. Duque Richard A. Bilas Commissioner Commissioner September 20, 2001",3285,"Will do.

Present were Don Sevrens, news editor/insight section; Bill Osborne, senior editor/opinion; Jim Gogek, editorial writer; Bernie Jones, editor, opinion pages; Craig Rose, the reporter who has written extensively on the topic, and a photographer. My two primary messages were that (1) wholesale and retail competition is working elsewhere, particularly in Pennsylvania, and can eventually work in California if the rules are changed, and (2) California has a severe supply shortage and needs to focus on providing incentives for new generation and expediting the permitting process. I was subtly trying to get across the message that leadership was needed to help Californians deal with the need to reconcile their environmental and land use goals with the need to bring their power supply and demand into balance. I, of course, defended FERC's order on the causes of the price volatility in California this summer and their lack of any authority to order retroactive refunds. I also pointed out that there were no findings of individual market abuse, so that refunds wouldn't be warranted even if there was legal authority. I also pointed out the problems with price caps. Other than Craig Rose, who disagreed with me any chance he got, the others asked good questions and seemed to be listening. They made the point repeatedly that this matter is very political, suggesting that a political compromise with the generators/marketers is necessary. One of them said he had heard there was a deal with the generators being negotiated and asked me my position. I responded that I had no response.

Present were Don Sevrens, news editor/insight section; Bill Osborne, senior editor/opinion; Jim Gogek, editorial writer; Bernie Jones, editor, opinion pages; Craig Rose, the reporter who has written extensively on the topic, and a photographer. My two primary messages were that (1) wholesale and retail competition is working elsewhere, particularly in Pennsylvania, and can eventually work in California if the rules are changed, and (2) California has a severe supply shortage and needs to focus on providing incentives for new generation and expediting the permitting process. I was subtly trying to get across the message that leadership was needed to help Californians deal with the need to reconcile their environmental and land use goals with the need to bring their power supply and demand into balance. I, of course, defended FERC's order on the causes of the price volatility in California this summer and their lack of any authority to order retroactive refunds. I also pointed out that there were no findings of individual market abuse, so that refunds wouldn't be warranted even if there was legal authority. I also pointed out the problems with price caps. Other than Craig Rose, who disagreed with me any chance he got, the others asked good questions and seemed to be listening. They made the point repeatedly that this matter is very political, suggesting that a political compromise with the generators/marketers is necessary. One of them said he had heard there was a deal with the generators being negotiated and asked me my position. I responded that I had no response.

This would result in a pretty small percentage. Another way to look at it would be on a % of load basis. If you use the DA load information Sue forwarded to us on October 1st, this % (5.7%) would also be very small. How do you think they will look at it?

Fielder wanted to talk about the negative CTC issue. Here's what he said: They plan to ""settle"" with the ESPs and pay them when they pay everyone else, which he re-iterated would be sometime in Q1'02. Edison is holding firm to the notion that the negative CTC contributed to the utility's undercollection and that the ESP's share of the undercollection has to be netted against the payables attributable to the negative CTC and owed the ESP. He said that they will propose to net it out in one of two ways: 1) lump sum netting (i.e., if they owe $50MM and the share of the undercollection is $30 MM, then they pay the ESP $20 MM; or 2) future reductions in PX Credit (i.e., they pay the ESP $50 MM, and then reduce the PX going forward until the $30 MM is paid down). The numbers are illustrative only. In addition, he said that they have the view that a decision is going to have to be made about 1) whether DA customers pay for stranded costs tied to the DWR L-T contracts, and 2) whether DA customers pay going forward for stranded costs tied to the QF contracts.

Would it be as simple as to determine their total (around $3 billion?) and gross receivable (before any payments - 145 million) and calculate the % (around 5%)? This would result in a pretty small percentage. Another way to look at it would be on a % of load basis. If you use the DA load information Sue forwarded to us on October 1st, this % (5.7%) would also be very small. How do you think they will look at it? I think we would all agree to a 5% haircut, if they would JUST PAY US!

Fielder wanted to talk about the negative CTC issue. Here's what he said: They plan to ""settle"" with the ESPs and pay them when they pay everyone else, which he re-iterated would be sometime in Q1'02. Edison is holding firm to the notion that the negative CTC contributed to the utility's undercollection and that the ESP's share of the undercollection has to be netted against the payables attributable to the negative CTC and owed the ESP. He said that they will propose to net it out in one of two ways: 1) lump sum netting (i.e., if they owe $50MM and the share of the undercollection is $30 MM, then they pay the ESP $20 MM; or 2) future reductions in PX Credit (i.e., they pay the ESP $50 MM, and then reduce the PX going forward until the $30 MM is paid down). The numbers are illustrative only. In addition, he said that they have the view that a decision is going to have to be made about 1) whether DA customers pay for stranded costs tied to the DWR L-T contracts, and 2) whether DA customers pay going forward for stranded costs tied to the QF contracts. (Edison is clearly lobbying the PUC to get DA customers to pay for these costs.) I recommended strongly that he de-link issues 1 and 2 above from the issue of paying us ASAP what they owe us for negative CTC. He agreed. He said that the PUC judge's recently issued pre-hearing conference order requires that Edison ""meet and confer"" with ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th hearing, and that Edison intends to set something up with ESPs prior to that hearing.

The company told the CPUC that Southern California Border (Topock, AZ) prices in the last month have risen by $2.50/MMBtu possibly because of market manipulation, in particular the withholding off of the market of pipeline transportation capacity between the supply basins and the California border. ""[T]here is substantial and compelling evidence that the basis differential has been and continues to be grossly distorted by market power abuse, collusion and affiliate self dealing of out-of-state gas suppliers and merchants,"" Edison told the CPUC. The company noted the CPUC already has filed a Section 5 complaint with FERC regarding this issue and is seeking a recision of ""certain allegedly collusive contracts which it contends have permitted out-of-state natural gas suppliers and their affiliates to drive up artificially California border gas prices by wrongfully withholding capacity."" It notes the complaint ""conservatively estimates that the anti-competitive manipulation of the basis differential has already damaged California gas and electricity users by $100 million annually since the beginning of 1998."" Edison seeks an expedited order authorizing it to use the posted gas price of $4.5133/MMBtu, which was applied to SCE's August 2000 avoided cost posting, to calculate its payment obligations to qualified power producers for the month of October and every month going forward. It estimated September bidweek border prices would average $7/MMBtu. If such prices were used in Edison's September avoided costs posting, its Transition Formula payments to certain independent power producers will be $29 million more than the month prior, the company told the CPUC.

Mike, I understand from our conversation yesterday that your following this on behalf of Questar. Do we know if the other pipelines have been active in any discussions on this bill? What about the generators? Have then been involved, since presumably, their in need of lots more capacity (and they're referenced in the bill)? What about large customers? They been screaming for more infrastructure, too, and many have blamed SoCalGas (and the PUC) for not delivering it. Do we know if pipelines, generators, large customers are supporting or opposing the bill? I'll try to check around, too, in between the electric mayhem. There doesn't seem to be anything in the bill that prevents the interstates from building into the state. If that's true, wouldn't the PUC take those projects into account when doing its analysis and only require the utility to construct (and noncore to take) capacity that isn't already being met by others (i.e., interstates) bringing pipe into the state? Any info you can provide on these fronts would be very useful. Don't want Enron too far out in front of opposition until we find out a bit more regarding 1) whose fer and agin it and 2) analysis of what the bill actually does/does not do.

What about the generators? Have then been involved, since presumably, their in need of lots more capacity (and they're referenced in the bill)? What about large customers? They been screaming for more infrastructure, too, and many have blamed SoCalGas (and the PUC) for not delivering it. Do we know if pipelines, generators, large customers are supporting or opposing the bill? I'll try to check around, too, in between the electric mayhem. There doesn't seem to be anything in the bill that prevents the interstates from building into the state. If that's true, wouldn't the PUC take those projects into account when doing its analysis and only require the utility to construct (and noncore to take) capacity that isn't already being met by others (i.e., interstates) bringing pipe into the state? Any info you can provide on these fronts would be very useful. Don't want Enron too far out in front of opposition until we find out a bit more regarding 1) whose fer and agin it and 2) analysis of what the bill actually does/does not do. Thanks again for the heads up.

Contract terms allow for renewal, or extension, by written agreement of the parties. Commencing on May 1, 2001 Enron agreed to pay Ken $4000/month at a maximum of 25 hours/month. Hours worked in excess of 25/month are paid at a rate of $160/hour. Termination of the contract requires that Enron give Ken Smith 30 days advance notice. If we choose to terminate, I suggest that Karen Denne contact Ken by telephone and also provide written notice of the termination immediately (unless you all agree that we should extend the contract). Please let me and Karen know how you want to proceed by close of business Thursday. Thanks"

If the Legislature doesn't get the MOU out well in advance of September 14th, Edison won't be focused, and I'd suggest that we try and reschedule. No matter the forum, the proposal will be tough to get through, even though it makes alot of economic sense. It's a big change, and big changes don't come easy, no matter the benefits. That said, no shots, no ducks. We ought to make a push. The proposal may not be contingent on Legislation. It might be possible to make it happen at the California PUC. Assignment to DWR would be significant and might require legislation (need to ask a QF lawyer). The proposal makes sense for both the IOUs and DWR, since both want as much ""headroom"" as possible in rates to cover their respective revenue requirements. Given the pending rate agreement between the CA PUC and DWR, and the utilities' messed-up financial position, DWR is clearly the preferable counter party from credit perspective. All that said, none of the above matters much unless the utility, a critical mass of QFs and the PUC's consumer advocate (""ORA"") buy into the idea. I'd propose that we continue with Edison. If Edison bites, then go jointly with Edison to persuade the QFs. If the QFs bite, then go jointly with Edison and QF to try to persuade ORA. On the issue of sleeving through the IOU or DWR, it seems useful to remain flexible on that, though absent general support from the IOUs, QFs and ORA, the entity will be academic.

One of the concerns I have is that the timing is such that it is unlikely, given the legislative session end of September 15th(??), that we are going to get much traction. (Aside from the fact that it seems difficult to convey the nuances of this deal over a conference call). It may not be relevant in this environment, but this idea makes sense. It is an issue of who will listen and who will act. It seems to make sense to propose the structure to DWR. Given the dilemma of how to marry both the Utilities' revenue requirement with that of DWRs on a go forward basis, anything that proposes to lower a portion of either of these revenue demands should be addressed. The proposal to DWR could go as follows: Either Edison and PG&E could separately participate in the dual auction process to buy out the QF agreement and replace with market energy or the contracts could be assigned to DWR and DWR could conduct the dual auction. Assignment of the contracts to DWR would be contingent on a successful auction process. A buyout of the high priced QF agreements would provide for added head room under the rate caps and thus provide a basis for the higher cost DWR contracts. In addition, it appears for our analysis, the savings would be such that you could roll in the outstanding debt owed to the QFs and not exceed the existing payment to the QF under the current capacity plus SRAC pricing. As such it seems that it could be construed as a restructuring of contracts and not a BAIL OUT of SCE. (I say this because my understanding of SB 78 is that a portion of the debt is to pay the back payments owed QFs. Is this portion of the bill being viewed by the radical contingent as a bail out?)

Budhraja was hired by the California Department of Water Resources to negotiate power contracts, but hasn't said which generators he dealt with in the weeks before the Williams contract was signed.

The Attorney General's office recently said it doesn't plan to investigate conflicts of interest involving energy contract negotiations. No one at the office could be reached for comment Monday. The California Public Utilities Commission is also petitioning federal regulators to throw out some of the state's $43 billion in long-term energy contracts, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Monday. The CPUC has argued in filings with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission over the past three months that energy companies took advantage of the state's energy crisis to negotiate high-priced contracts, according to the report. The average price of power under the contracts is $69 a megawatt-hour, more than double peak electricity prices last week.

The Attorney General's office recently said it doesn't plan to investigate conflicts of interest involving energy contract negotiations. No one at the office could be reached for comment Monday. The California Public Utilities Commission is also petitioning federal regulators to throw out some of the state's $43 billion in long-term energy contracts, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Monday. The CPUC has argued in filings with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission over the past three months that energy companies took advantage of the state's energy crisis to negotiate high-priced contracts, according to the report. The average price of power under the contracts is $69 a megawatt-hour, more than double peak electricity prices last week. CPUC lawyers have filed challenges before the FERC on deals negotiated with Scottish Power (SPI <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=SPI>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=SPI>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=SPI>) unit PacifiCorp, Alliance Colton LLC, Sempra Energy (SRE <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=SRE>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=SRE>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=SRE>) and Calpine Corp.

Budhraja disclosed in August that he owned as much as $10,000 in Scottish Power stock while a $1 billion long-term contract with subsidiary PacifiCorp was being hammered out. The state signed the 10-year contract July 6. Budraha sold his stock July 30. State officials say Budhraja had nothing to do with the deal, according to the report."

It could include more bells and whistles, but the intent of this proposal is to get DA back as soon as possible. ************************************************************************** Reduce DWR L-T contract volumes by at least 33-50% To ""back fill"" increase in net-short created by contract reformation, permit noncore customers (20 KW and above) to elect to go DA to fill the position DA provides a significantly more efficient hedge against price volatility than DWR contracts Election is first-come, first-serve, capped at the aggregate net short position Customers decision to go DA will constitute a 3-year commitment to stay DA (i.e., can't go back to IOU for 3 yrs; must stay in the market) If a net short position remains after noncore customers have elected DA (i.e., not enough elect to fill the net short), then the IOUs will hold an auction to fill the net short The auction would seek a portfolio of 3 month, 6 month, 1 year and 3 year deals (both peak and off-peak) to fill the net short. Noncore customers choosing DA would not escape costs of DWR power consumed when the customer was receiving utility service (i.e., prior to electing DA) Likewise, if the noncore customers choosing DA was a utility customer during the period when the utility accured its ""undercollection,"" (i.e., when wholesale prices exceeded the retail cap), the customer would not escape those costs by virtue of electing DA status Noncore customers would not bear responsibility for recovery of DWR L-T contracts. Potential add-on to deal: Core customers (less than 20 KW) could choose ""green only"" DA, but, like, noncore customers could not escape costs for which they are responsible.",5276,"Ms Denne, at Enron, we use the more polite form, ""deep doo-doo.""","-----Original Message----- From: Denne, Karen Sent: Thursday, October 11, 2001 4:37 PM To: Dasovich, Jeff Subject: RE: Conversation w/Jerry Hirsch of LA Times I can't top that.

Best, Jeff ********************************************************************************************************** -----Original Message----- From: Dasovich, Jeff Sent: Tuesday, October 09, 2001 10:53 AM To: Shapiro, Richard; Steffes, James D.; Mara, Susan Subject: Rick: Based on your voicemail, here's a quick-and-dirty synopsis of a proposal that I've been quietly discussing with a select few out here in California (e.g., John White, large customers). It could include more bells and whistles, but the intent of this proposal is to get DA back as soon as possible. ************************************************************************** Reduce DWR L-T contract volumes by at least 33-50% To ""back fill"" increase in net-short created by contract reformation, permit noncore customers (20 KW and above) to elect to go DA to fill the position DA provides a significantly more efficient hedge against price volatility than DWR contracts Election is first-come, first-serve, capped at the aggregate net short position Customers decision to go DA will constitute a 3-year commitment to stay DA (i.e., can't go back to IOU for 3 yrs; must stay in the market) If a net short position remains after noncore customers have elected DA (i.e., not enough elect to fill the net short), then the IOUs will hold an auction to fill the net short The auction would seek a portfolio of 3 month, 6 month, 1 year and 3 year deals (both peak and off-peak) to fill the net short. Noncore customers choosing DA would not escape costs of DWR power consumed when the customer was receiving utility service (i.e., prior to electing DA) Likewise, if the noncore customers choosing DA was a utility customer during the period when the utility accured its ""undercollection,"" (i.e., when wholesale prices exceeded the retail cap), the customer would not escape those costs by virtue of electing DA status Noncore customers would not bear responsibility for recovery of DWR L-T contracts. Potential add-on to deal: Core customers (less than 20 KW) could choose ""green only"" DA, but, like, noncore customers could not escape costs for which they are responsible."

With respect to funding future (more moderate growth), the company does have some room to increase long-term debt (e.g., current ratio for 1986 = 2.26). It seems that HD would get better terms and have increased flexibility by issuing additional debt rather than relying on lines of credit.

Ditto for Nicor. I have a call in to those that know first hand about these latter three utilities so I'll forward that answer as soon as I receive it. Please call if you have any questions or if can be of further assistance. << File: COHdftComp.DOC >> << File: HessCompl.pdf >> << File: HessCompl2.pdf >> Leslie Lawner/ENRON@enronXgate 09/19/2001 02:29 PM To: Janine Migden/ENRON@enronXgate, Jeff Dasovich/ENRON@enronXgate, Roy Boston/HOU/EES@EES cc: Colleen Sullivan/ENRON@enronXgate Subject: FW: OFOs Can you folks help me get the info on OFOs on the LDCs below to Colleen Sullivan, who is working with EES on this. Thanks. -----Original Message----- From: Sullivan, Colleen Sent: Wednesday, September 19, 2001 11:17 AM To: Lawner, Leslie Subject: OFOs Last week I asked you about OFOs and you requested a list of the LDCs we are most interested in. At this time (and in this order), I need any information you can give us on OFO history (frequency, actual dates, reason for OFO--system long or short?, etc.) on the following LDCs: PG&E, Socal NIGAS, Peoples (Chicago), Northshore Columbia of Ohio This is a good starting point for now. Just so you know, we need this data as we are trying to verify/set/modify (whatever you want to call it), the price curves being set by the traders reflecting LDC risk. Obviously, the frequency of OFOs will affect our risk of doing business on a particular LDC, so we need to try to compare and access charges associated with each. Any help or direction you can provide on where to get this data would be most appreciated."

Prior to the meeting the California folks were given a list of topic areas and specific questions relating to the respective topics. I have a list of those questions that I will be happy to provide if your interested. Following are some notes regarding the discussion that took place. The first topic area was about the projected load/resource balance for this summer in California. The Californian's provided a one page listing of the various resources and anticipated loads that they expect to exist this summer. They expect Peak Demand + 7% Reserves to be 61,125 MW's. They have 59,209 in total ""existing resources."" They expect to have 3,050 MW off the existing resources off-line for much of the summer. The net short position is 4,966 MW. Governor Davis expects 5,053 MW of new generation. The Oversight Board and CEC believe this is probably going to be 2,500 MW at best. Many of the numbers were based on some suspect assumptions, including such things as an expectation that BPA will be in a position to make some exports to Cal this summer. A second topic area is air quality. Governor Davis has asked all of the local Air Quality management Districts to relax emission standards for this summer. The problem is that California has some rules requiring older plants to comply with BACT by 1-1-2002. Many plant owners have ordered the equipment to comply and are anticipating being down to install this. There is no single coordinator with reliable information on these planned outages. NW Power Planning Council staff told the Californian's that they should expect the NW Hydro system to be 4000 MW below normal through October, beyond that who knows. It was interesting to listen to the CEC explain how California has gone from a system that didn't allow long-term energy contracts to the current effort to secure long-term contracts with little capability to manage spot and short-term transactions. According to the Cal guys, the state expects to be severely energy constrained starting in June, even if they manage to have capacity. This is largely a function of gas supply. An economist from the Washington State Energy Office said the between 1997 and 2004 Washington has seen a 150 % increase in demand for natural gas. He said Oregon is up 110% in that same time frame. Apparently much of the supply to get through this winter is coming from storage which will have to be replenished, creating a conflict with anticipated generation capability this summer. California is starting to discuss an industrial curtailment program for this summer. Like so many of California's efforts, there is no coordinated effort around this program. The CEC said they are bracing for 20-100 hours of blackouts this summer. While this doesn't sound like a lot, I believe the blackouts at the end of the year were only about 5-10 hours ( this is a guess on my part based on what I recall from news reports).

Redding (PS, NE) (E-mail); Mike Florio (E-mail) Subject: Bond Leg Language, etc. Greetings: Hope everyone had a pleasant 4th. I've read the respective Burton and Hertzberg language on amending AB 1X. The Burton language looks cleaner and simpler, though there may be reasons to include some of the Hertzberg language, too. I'm proposing to the group the following as potential amendments to the bond bill. I would appreciate your feedback. The amendments would be as follows: Customers who were on Direct Access when DWR started buying power (Jan. 17th?), and are still on Direct Access when the bill passes, should be exempt from paying for the bonds. In short, customers should not be forced to pay for power twice--once from their ESP, and once from DWR. Since these customers receive power services from their ESP, they never consumed DWR power in the first place and it wouldn't be fair to require them to pay for it. Customers who have been utility customers since DWR started buying power but subsequently switched to Direct Access should only pay for power provided by DWR that they actually consumed, no more and no less. For example, if a customer was a utility customer when DWR started buying power but switched to Direct Access on May 1st, then the customer would only be responsible for reimbursing DWR for power deliveries that took place from Jan. 17th thru April 30th. I believe that we agreed on these concepts during the negotiations that took place over the past 4-5 weeks. Or if we didn't explicitly agree during the talks, they seem to be principles on which we ought to be able to agree pretty easily now. And rather than leave the issue hanging, which can create unnecessary and costly uncertainty for customers, I suggest that we include very clear and simple legislative language in the bond bill clarifying what customers' obligations are. Your thoughts are appreciated. In addition, we have talked quite a bit about providing customers with incentives in the attempt to get California out of the energy hole that it finds itself in. Providing (20KW and above) customers with an incentive to switch to Direct Access as soon as possible could 1) reduce the net short position that the state (and ultimately consumers) have to finance, thereby reducing spot purchases and price volatility, 2) reduce electricity purchasing costs, and 3) reduce the burden on the state budget. With this in mind, I'm also proposing that the group consider an amendment to the bond bill that would exempt from bond charges any customer that switches to Direct Access by September 1st. Finally, it seems odd that the language directing the PUC to suspend Direct Access is still in the bill. If a dedicated rate component is created, that seems to eliminate altogether the need to suspend Direct Access. And if that's the case, would it make sense to delete that language from the bill? Look forward to your comments and working with you to get support for and passage of the ""core/noncore"" proposal.

Redding (PS, NE) (E-mail); Mike Florio (E-mail) Subject: Bond Leg Language, etc. Greetings: Hope everyone had a pleasant 4th. I've read the respective Burton and Hertzberg language on amending AB 1X. The Burton language looks cleaner and simpler, though there may be reasons to include some of the Hertzberg language, too. I'm proposing to the group the following as potential amendments to the bond bill. I would appreciate your feedback. The amendments would be as follows: Customers who were on Direct Access when DWR started buying power (Jan. 17th?), and are still on Direct Access when the bill passes, should be exempt from paying for the bonds. In short, customers should not be forced to pay for power twice--once from their ESP, and once from DWR. Since these customers receive power services from their ESP, they never consumed DWR power in the first place and it wouldn't be fair to require them to pay for it. Customers who have been utility customers since DWR started buying power but subsequently switched to Direct Access should only pay for power provided by DWR that they actually consumed, no more and no less. For example, if a customer was a utility customer when DWR started buying power but switched to Direct Access on May 1st, then the customer would only be responsible for reimbursing DWR for power deliveries that took place from Jan. 17th thru April 30th. I believe that we agreed on these concepts during the negotiations that took place over the past 4-5 weeks. Or if we didn't explicitly agree during the talks, they seem to be principles on which we ought to be able to agree pretty easily now. And rather than leave the issue hanging, which can create unnecessary and costly uncertainty for customers, I suggest that we include very clear and simple legislative language in the bond bill clarifying what customers' obligations are. Your thoughts are appreciated. In addition, we have talked quite a bit about providing customers with incentives in the attempt to get California out of the energy hole that it finds itself in. Providing (20KW and above) customers with an incentive to switch to Direct Access as soon as possible could 1) reduce the net short position that the state (and ultimately consumers) have to finance, thereby reducing spot purchases and price volatility, 2) reduce electricity purchasing costs, and 3) reduce the burden on the state budget. With this in mind, I'm also proposing that the group consider an amendment to the bond bill that would exempt from bond charges any customer that switches to Direct Access by September 1st. Finally, it seems odd that the language directing the PUC to suspend Direct Access is still in the bill. If a dedicated rate component is created, that seems to eliminate altogether the need to suspend Direct Access. And if that's the case, would it make sense to delete that language from the bill? Look forward to your comments and working with you to get support for and passage of the ""core/noncore"" proposal.

Briefly, some of you know that I attended Berkeley's Policy School. I have been very closely involved with the conference Severin describes in his note to Littlechild. I have been working to try to establish a joint venture between the policy and business schools at Berkeley to hold an ""energy summit,"" where national and international energy leaders would converge on California (under the auspices of UC Berkeley) to talk energy policy. Jim Steffes has helped a lot in brainstorming the idea. In short,, our goal was to have a group of prominent folks squarely refute the extremely retrograde notions of ""turn the clock back"" that the Governor of California's two most recent appointees have been articulating at every opportunity over the past several months, and re-seize the agenda in California. The ""energy heads of state"" at the summit would come up with solutions for going forward. The concept (and invitees) that Severin describes is loosely based on proposals I have made to the ""steering committee."" However, for reasons I won't bore you with in this note, the effort has frankly turned into a fiasco. I notified the group this week that Enron would not be participating, that they should go forward with the conference without us, and that I would help somewhat (contacts, etc.) when (and if) they ever came to agreement on the agenda and particpants. From my perspective, the effort turned out to be a rather big disappointment. I urge us not to get involved or contribute $$s. At this juncture I would recommend against having Ken Lay participate.

Then answer the questions, if you can, or refer them to me or Ken for further follow-up 3)describe your own experience at school and how it has worked with your career--timing, advancement, scheduling, tuition payments, etc. 4)invite them to attend a class so we can show them around.

So, Meg called and asked me to contact one of the individuals on your list of names because that person - Ashish Bhargava- had a specific question around choosing between day and evening programs. Since I had to make a similar decision, Meg thought I should talk to him. If you have already called him, don't worry about it. If not, go ahead and we can trade someone from my list, and I will call Ashish. Just let me know who you pick on my list!

We all have five or six people to call in the next 7-10 days. I made a couple of matches where it seemed there was some kind of similarity in background or career, but for the most part, the assignments were essentially random. The list includes names, phones at home and work, company and title. Remember these are newly admitted students who have not yet accepted our offer of admission. The deadline to accept this offer is April 27th. A general outline of the phone call, should you choose to use it, would be: 1) Congratulations on being admitted to the Haas School 2) indentify yourself as ""involved with the student government at the Haas School, and the evening office asked me to give you a call to see if you had any questions about the program. Then answer the questions, if you can, or refer them to me or Ken for further follow-up 3)describe your own experience at school and how it has worked with your career--timing, advancement, scheduling, tuition payments, etc. 4)invite them to attend a class so we can show them around.

One of the concerns I have is that the timing is such that it is unlikely, given the legislative session end of September 15th(??), that we are going to get much traction. (Aside from the fact that it seems difficult to convey the nuances of this deal over a conference call). It may not be relevant in this environment, but this idea makes sense. It is an issue of who will listen and who will act. It seems to make sense to propose the structure to DWR. Given the dilemma of how to marry both the Utilities' revenue requirement with that of DWRs on a go forward basis, anything that proposes to lower a portion of either of these revenue demands should be addressed. The proposal to DWR could go as follows: Either Edison and PG&E could separately participate in the dual auction process to buy out the QF agreement and replace with market energy or the contracts could be assigned to DWR and DWR could conduct the dual auction. Assignment of the contracts to DWR would be contingent on a successful auction process. A buyout of the high priced QF agreements would provide for added head room under the rate caps and thus provide a basis for the higher cost DWR contracts. In addition, it appears for our analysis, the savings would be such that you could roll in the outstanding debt owed to the QFs and not exceed the existing payment to the QF under the current capacity plus SRAC pricing. As such it seems that it could be construed as a restructuring of contracts and not a BAIL OUT of SCE. (I say this because my understanding of SB 78 is that a portion of the debt is to pay the back payments owed QFs. Is this portion of the bill being viewed by the radical contingent as a bail out?)

The Utility Reform Network and Consumers Union asked Lockyer to examine whether income earned from energy companies by consultant Vikram Budhraja presented a conflict of interest, because he may have been involved in contract negotiations with those companies We believe there is ample evidence for the Attorney General to investigate whether some of the state's electricity contracts were made in violation of California's conflict of interest laws,"" said Bill Ahern, senior policy analyst with Consumers Union West Coast Regional Office. ""If the Attorney General finds that a contract was made in violation of the law, it must be set aside as void."" Three weeks after Budhraja's January hire date, Williams Companies (WMB, news, msgs) won a $3.4 billion contract to provide power to the state over 10 1/2 years. Budhraja disclosed in mid-August that his company, the Electric Power Group, was paid more than $10,000 by Williams during the previous 12 months. Budhraja was hired by the California Department of Water Resources to negotiate power contracts, but hasn't said which generators he dealt with in the weeks before the Williams contract was signed. ""It is reasonable to assume that Budhraja may have been involved in the negotiations that led to the Williams contract,"" Ahern said. ""It is also likely that there are more detailed records and evidence in existence, which only a subpoena or search warrant may uncover."" The groups also are concerned that Budhraja may have held a conflict of interest due to his potential involvement in negotiating a $3.9 billion contract with Allegheny Energy Inc. (AYE, news, msgs) while he owned stocks in energy companies, according to the release. The Attorney General's office recently said it doesn't plan to investigate conflicts of interest involving energy contract negotiations. No one at the office could be reached for comment Monday. The California Public Utilities Commission is also petitioning federal regulators to throw out some of the state's $43 billion in long-term energy contracts, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Monday. The CPUC has argued in filings with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission over the past three months that energy companies took advantage of the state's energy crisis to negotiate high-priced contracts, according to the report. The average price of power under the contracts is $69 a megawatt-hour, more than double peak electricity prices last week. CPUC lawyers have filed challenges before the FERC on deals negotiated with Scottish Power (SPI, news, msgs) unit PacifiCorp, Alliance Colton LLC, Sempra Energy (SRE, news, msgs) and Calpine Corp. (CPN, news, msgs), according to the report. Budhraja disclosed in August that he owned as much as $10,000 in Scottish Power stock while a $1 billion long-term contract with subsidiary PacifiCorp was being hammered out. The state signed the 10-year contract July 6. Budraha sold his stock July 30.

In its decision denying the Petitions, the Commission did however modify its initial decision in several respects. ??????? Key among those is a modification regarding facility adds. ??????? Those comments refer to the ability to continue to submit DASRs for new facilities under contracts signed prior to September 20th that provide for facility adds. ??????? The Commission agreed and has ordered the utilities to accept DASRs for facility adds under contract terms executed prior to 10.20.01. The precise language is cited below. ??????? If you would like a copy of the decision, please contact Joseph Alamo. Best, Jeff ""We reaffirm that for the time being, and unless the Commission states otherwise in a subsequent decision, utilities are required to process DASRs relating to contracts or agreements that were executed on or before September 20th, 2001, including DASRs for service to new facilities or accounts if the underlying contract pursuant to which those DASRs are submitted allowed for the provision of that additional service. Thus, for example, with respect to the specific ESP contract described by UC/CSU in their rehearing application, the utilities are required to accept, even after September 20, 2001, any DASRs they receive that legitimatley relate to that contract...[W]e want to make it clear that...utilities cannot set a deadline after which they could refuse to process DASRs relating to contracts executed on or before September 20, 2001."" pp 20-21"

Fielder wanted to talk about the negative CTC issue. Here's what he said: They plan to ""settle"" with the ESPs and pay them when they pay everyone else, which he re-iterated would be sometime in Q1'02. Edison is holding firm to the notion that the negative CTC contributed to the utility's undercollection and that the ESP's share of the undercollection has to be netted against the payables attributable to the negative CTC and owed the ESP. He said that they will propose to net it out in one of two ways: 1) lump sum netting (i.e., if they owe $50MM and the share of the undercollection is $30 MM, then they pay the ESP $20 MM; or 2) future reductions in PX Credit (i.e., they pay the ESP $50 MM, and then reduce the PX going forward until the $30 MM is paid down). The numbers are illustrative only. In addition, he said that they have the view that a decision is going to have to be made about 1) whether DA customers pay for stranded costs tied to the DWR L-T contracts, and 2) whether DA customers pay going forward for stranded costs tied to the QF contracts. (Edison is clearly lobbying the PUC to get DA customers to pay for these costs.) I recommended strongly that he de-link issues 1 and 2 above from the issue of paying us ASAP what they owe us for negative CTC. He agreed. He said that the PUC judge's recently issued pre-hearing conference order requires that Edison ""meet and confer"" with ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th hearing, and that Edison intends to set something up with ESPs prior to that hearing. Fielder is also the point person on ""getting ESPs paid"" and intends to initiate settlement discussions with ESPs week after next. It was very clear from the conversation that Edison is going to do everything possible (at the expense of creditors) to maximize headroom under the settlement it struck with the PUC a few weeks ago. Edison's stalemate with the QFs is evidence of it. We shouldn't assume anything different with the Negative CTC issue. If you have any questions, let us know. Best, Jeff",3150,"Yes.

California Power-Buying Data Disclosed in Misdirected E-Mail By Daniel Taub Sacramento, California, July 6 (Bloomberg) -- California Governor Gray Davis's office released data on the state's purchases in the spot electricity market -- information Davis has been trying to keep secret -- through a misdirected e-mail. The e-mail, containing data on California's power purchases yesterday, was intended for members of the governor's staff, said Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio. It was accidentally sent to some reporters on the office's press list, he said. Davis is fighting disclosure of state power purchases, saying it would compromise negotiations for future contracts. This week, Davis appealed a state judge's order to release spot-market invoices, purchase orders and confirmation sheets for power contracts signed through June 27.

California paid an average of $132 on the spot market, according to the e-mail. Prices on the spot market tend to be higher than on the day-ahead market.

Fielder wanted to talk about the negative CTC issue. Here's what he said: They plan to ""settle"" with the ESPs and pay them when they pay everyone else, which he re-iterated would be sometime in Q1'02. Edison is holding firm to the notion that the negative CTC contributed to the utility's undercollection and that the ESP's share of the undercollection has to be netted against the payables attributable to the negative CTC and owed the ESP. He said that they will propose to net it out in one of two ways: 1) lump sum netting (i.e., if they owe $50MM and the share of the undercollection is $30 MM, then they pay the ESP $20 MM; or 2) future reductions in PX Credit (i.e., they pay the ESP $50 MM, and then reduce the PX going forward until the $30 MM is paid down). The numbers are illustrative only. In addition, he said that they have the view that a decision is going to have to be made about 1) whether DA customers pay for stranded costs tied to the DWR L-T contracts, and 2) whether DA customers pay going forward for stranded costs tied to the QF contracts. (Edison is clearly lobbying the PUC to get DA customers to pay for these costs.) I recommended strongly that he de-link issues 1 and 2 above from the issue of paying us ASAP what they owe us for negative CTC. He agreed. He said that the PUC judge's recently issued pre-hearing conference order requires that Edison ""meet and confer"" with ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th hearing, and that Edison intends to set something up with ESPs prior to that hearing. Fielder is also the point person on ""getting ESPs paid"" and intends to initiate settlement discussions with ESPs week after next. It was very clear from the conversation that Edison is going to do everything possible (at the expense of creditors) to maximize headroom under the settlement it struck with the PUC a few weeks ago.

Until we see how the direct access suspension implementation issues are resolved, there is a signficant probability that the utilities will insist on seeing all documents related to an ESP agreement, and will go screaming to the commission to turn off your DA service if it appears any portion of the agreement was executed after Sept. 20. As indicated in previous calls, that does not mean an ESP agreement executed prior to Sept 20 cannot be amended as to price and other such terms, but it cannot be extended or renewed so as to give the customer longer access to direct access without raising the risk that the CPUC will invalidate the extension IF it chooses to forbid extensions and renewals after Sept. 20. At this time we do not know when or if the CPUC will address these issues, although as Sue Mara has reported, there will be a Rule 22 meeting in a week which will likely result in utility filings to get clarification from the commission on these issues. Beyond that we have no idea of the procedural schedule the Commission will follow in addressing these issues. Bottom line: The existing commercial deals should not be put at risk by means of amendments as to term of the agreement which were executed after Sept. 20. Follow on extensions or renewals to take effect at the end of the existing agreements can be signed, but will remain at risk untilthe renewal or extension issue is addressed by the Commission. Post Sept. 20 amendments to the price term of existing agreements are very likely safe so long as the pre-Sept 20 term and quantity of the contracts are not altered.

Rick - I just got a call from Ian Fletcher, head of the Utilities Regulation unit at the UK Department of Trade and Industry. He reports to Anna Walker, the Director General of Energy at the DTI. Ian also knows Paul, and I am sure that he only called me because he now knew of my US location. Anyway, here is what he asked: They have a highly regarded junior civil servant, Edward Barker (Paul and I have both met him, and rate him high), who is getting married, and wants to locate to Los Angeles for a year while his fiance/wife completes a Ph.D. at some school there. The UK DTI will keep paying him, so he is effectively free to us. They want a relevant job/work experience for him. Ian does not know about his willingness to commute during the week from San Francisco to LA (I told Ian we were receptive to these kinds of things, if all else worked out), but will check. I think it would be good for Enron (Paul D. may have views on this), not only for endearing Enron to key relationships at DTI, but exposing a UK civil servant to the transparency of our regulation, US-style, cannot hurt either, as that is something Paul is on a long march to improve in the UK. I would think challenging research, attendance at settlement conferences, some memo writing, etc. would be sufficient (actually, that would be a bit below the policy-formation role he now occupies), but do you have any thoughts?

Rick - I just got a call from Ian Fletcher, head of the Utilities Regulation unit at the UK Department of Trade and Industry. He reports to Anna Walker, the Director General of Energy at the DTI. Ian also knows Paul, and I am sure that he only called me because he now knew of my US location. Anyway, here is what he asked: They have a highly regarded junior civil servant, Edward Barker (Paul and I have both met him, and rate him high), who is getting married, and wants to locate to Los Angeles for a year while his fiance/wife completes a Ph.D. at some school there. The UK DTI will keep paying him, so he is effectively free to us. They want a relevant job/work experience for him. Ian does not know about his willingness to commute during the week from San Francisco to LA (I told Ian we were receptive to these kinds of things, if all else worked out), but will check. I think it would be good for Enron (Paul D. may have views on this), not only for endearing Enron to key relationships at DTI, but exposing a UK civil servant to the transparency of our regulation, US-style, cannot hurt either, as that is something Paul is on a long march to improve in the UK. I would think challenging research, attendance at settlement conferences, some memo writing, etc. would be sufficient (actually, that would be a bit below the policy-formation role he now occupies), but do you have any thoughts? I can get his CV when you need it. thanks mcs"

Jim -----Original Message----- From: Swain, Steve Sent: Friday, October 12, 2001 1:19 PM To: Dasovich, Jeff; Mara, Susan; Steffes, James D. Subject: RE: CA question Before we carry this much further, let me explain some more why I raised the question in the first place. We currently assume that our exposure to CTC going forward is zero. Arthur Andersen was questioning this assumption, as market prices in general are lower than embedded gen now (unless you include DWR costs), which implies that if we were under the old CTC regime we could be paying some positive CTC. AA was wondering why we weren't holding some reserves for this eventuality. Mary Lynne and I told them we weren't reserving b/c we just have no clear idea what will happen in the coming months re:CTC, but that in all likelihood zero is the best guess b/c no one can agree on what PX credit (""market"" price) is now that there is no PX. Besides, though SCE and PG&E are arguing for different methods (the so-called ""top-down"" and ""bottom-up""), in the end the result will be about the same (CTC=0), especially now that PG&E has supposedly stopped ""adjusting"" the PX credit to recover past undercollections. And of course, the DWR contracts muddy the waters, since if one includes them in the calculation of utility gen costs, then you could easily get to a negative CTC situation. Bottom line: we think things are so screwed up that everyone will prefer just to ignore CTC for the few months remaining that it has to run. In light of all this we thought we might further quell AA's skepticism if we could show that although we had once argued that DJI should be used as a substitute for PX credit, we were now simply arguing that DA should pay T&D only, and that CTC should become a relic of the past. I think by now it may be a dead issue -- I believe AA has accepted our arguments w/o this extra bit of persuasion, else I would have heard more from Mary Lynne.

Jim -----Original Message----- From: Swain, Steve Sent: Friday, October 12, 2001 1:19 PM To: Dasovich, Jeff; Mara, Susan; Steffes, James D. Subject: RE: CA question Before we carry this much further, let me explain some more why I raised the question in the first place. We currently assume that our exposure to CTC going forward is zero. Arthur Andersen was questioning this assumption, as market prices in general are lower than embedded gen now (unless you include DWR costs), which implies that if we were under the old CTC regime we could be paying some positive CTC. AA was wondering why we weren't holding some reserves for this eventuality. Mary Lynne and I told them we weren't reserving b/c we just have no clear idea what will happen in the coming months re:CTC, but that in all likelihood zero is the best guess b/c no one can agree on what PX credit (""market"" price) is now that there is no PX. Besides, though SCE and PG&E are arguing for different methods (the so-called ""top-down"" and ""bottom-up""), in the end the result will be about the same (CTC=0), especially now that PG&E has supposedly stopped ""adjusting"" the PX credit to recover past undercollections. And of course, the DWR contracts muddy the waters, since if one includes them in the calculation of utility gen costs, then you could easily get to a negative CTC situation. Bottom line: we think things are so screwed up that everyone will prefer just to ignore CTC for the few months remaining that it has to run. In light of all this we thought we might further quell AA's skepticism if we could show that although we had once argued that DJI should be used as a substitute for PX credit, we were now simply arguing that DA should pay T&D only, and that CTC should become a relic of the past. I think by now it may be a dead issue -- I believe AA has accepted our arguments w/o this extra bit of persuasion, else I would have heard more from Mary Lynne. Thanks for all the background and input from everyone, and please let me know if you have any more relevant comments given this context. > -----Original Message----- > From: Dasovich, Jeff > Sent: Friday, October 12, 2001 10:16 AM > To: Mara, Susan; Steffes, James D.; Swain, Steve > Subject: RE: CA question > > Recognizing that it was Sue's idea (though I'm not sure, Sue, > if you're referring to the DJ index or the bottoms-up > approach), isn't it also true that Harry submitted some > testimony more recently regarding the DJ index method, and > didn't ARM more recently submit some bottoms-up testimony, > comments, etc.? > > Best, > Jeff > > -----Original Message----- > From: Mara, Susan > Sent: Friday, October 12, 2001 12:13 PM > To: Dasovich, Jeff; Steffes, James D.; Swain, Steve > Subject: RE: CA question > > All, > > I think I actually was the one who proposed it in a 1998 > ""RAP"" case three years ago.

The vote was 4-1, with the two Republicans voting with Davis' hand-picked appointees Lynch and Wood. Davis' proposal was introduced at the meeting by another Davis appointee--Geoff Brown--who made a lengthy speech about why California would experience economic and political destruction if the PUC did not approve Davis' proposed rate agreement. What is Davis' proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC? It would remove all PUC authority to review any contracts between DWR with suppliers. It would require the PUC to pass through to utility rates all DWR power contract costs, no questions asked. What are the implications of the move by the PUC to reject Davis' proposal? With the vote, it remains unclear how California/DWR will pay for the DWR power contracts. The political pressure to re-negotiate--or break--the DWR power contracts is likely to intensify considerably. It remains unclear how California/DWR will pay for the $12.5 B in bonds the Treasurer has unsuccessfully attempted to issue for past several months. Under the structure devised by Davis, the revenues flowing from the CPUC/DWR rate agreement would be used to both 1) pay for the DWR power contracts and 2) service the bonds the Treasurer is trying to issue to repay California's General Fund for spot and other short term power purchased by DWR since January. In short, there is no clear indication of how California will pay for DWR contracts or issue the bonds. Safe to say that today's PUC vote has seriously embarrassed Davis, and left his approach to ""solving"" California electricity crisis in shambles. What Next? A broad left-right coalition of energy interests supported a bill (18XX) that passed the Legislature with broad bi-partisan support. The bill would create a ""dedicated rate component"" on every customers bill to service the $12.5 B in bonds that the Treasurer wants to issue. Proponents of the bill--and just about everyone else--argue that the ""dedicated rate component"" is a signficantly more efficient way to raise the debt California needs to plug the hole in its budget. The bill is silent, however, on how California would pay for the DWR contracts, and the bill's opponents claim that the power suppliers will sue as a result. All four PUC commissioners who voted against the Davis rate agreement today urged Davis to sign the bill. The left-right coalition (from Nader types to oil companies) is also working hard to get Davis to sign it. Davis has said that he will veto the bill on the advice of the Treasurer and bond counsel. Given today's vote, however, Davis may have no alternative than to sign the bill if he wants to get the bonds issued and the state budget repaid. Update on Edison Bailout Still appears that chances are very small that Edison and Davis will succeed in getting the Legislature to vote for an Edison bailout when it returns for another ""special"" session next Tuesday.
