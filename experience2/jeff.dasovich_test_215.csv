The purpose of the meeting was to brief us on their activities and their gameplan for trying to find a solution for California. Here's a summary of the meeting. Please keep confidential. Work will be done over the weekend to put the core/noncore proposal in legislative language. (We will be in the room.) Work done by the ""Plan B"" group in the Assembly (Joe Dutra and Joe Nation) will also be put into legislative language over the weekend. Because no proposal is ""comprehensive,"" a complete legislative package will be created from the various pieces that have been worked on thus far (i.e., core/noncore, ""Plan B,"" Edison MOU) In addition, there are Republican demands that Hertzberg will need to address (e.g., end the litigation) in order to achieve bi-partison support, which is what Hertzberg's shooting for. To move the legislation, the plan is to establish a ""conference committee,"" comprised of an equal number of Democrats and Republicans. The committe would begin work on Monday and would attempt to finish putting a comprehensive bill together, vote it out of the Legislature and send it to the Governor for signing by Monday, July 16th. July 16th is the deadline because that is the date that the PUC will issue its proposed decision regarding, among other things, how DWR's revenue requirement will be put into rates, whether Direct Access needs to be suspended, etc. The PUC is issuing the draft on the 16th in order to give everyone 30 days to review and comment before the Commission votes on a final order on August 15th. (The PUC will actually issue a ""thought piece"" on Monday the 9th and will use reactions to the ""thought piece"" to craft the develop the proposed decision it plans to issue on the 16th.) All of this is still up in the air, however. As of right now, the leader of the Senate (Burton) has not agreed to Hertzberg's gameplan and the Republicans, while interested, have not yet committed to join the process. <Embedded StdOleLink> <Embedded StdOleLink>",4015,"can we talk about this?

Subject: Call to Discuss Possible Options to Mitigate Effect of DWR Contracts--Privileged and Confidential Sensitivity: Confidential PLEASE KEEP THIS NOTE, AND THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE NOTE CONFIDENTIAL. As folks are aware, we have been engaged in closed-door negotiations for the past two weeks regarding a possible market-based solution to California's electricity crisis. In the room are the major large customer groups, environmentalists, small customers (TURN), Independent Energy Producers, labor, the Western States Petroleum Association, and Enron. The negotiations were convened by the Speaker of the Assembly (Bob Hertzberg). When Hertzberg convened the meeting, he told the parties that he wanted to achieve a core/noncore structure, similar to the structure in place in California's gas market (i.e., large customers are required to buy gas from the market, with Direct Access available to all other customers). In effect, ""core"" customers (rez and small business) would be served by the utilities' retained generating assets and QF contracts; and large customers would go to market. The core/noncore structure would begin 1.1.03. The negotiating group has struggled over the past two weeks, but is close devising a framework for core/noncore in Californis (but who pays for the utilities' past debts and the costs of DWR power purchased between January and today remain very contentious). Unfortunately, with the release of the information regarding the DWR contracts last Friday, it is now clear that achieving a core/noncore structure will be very difficult unless something is done to mitigate the contracts. The problem is that, if core is served by utility gen and QFs, and large customers are in the market, there is no (or very little) need for the DWR contracts. Instead, they look like a signficant stranded cost. Hertzberg and the negotiating group are looking to Enron for creative ways to address ""the DWR contract problem"" in order to prevent the contracts from 1) killing the core/noncore deal and 2) forcing California to accept a structure focused on a state power authority headed-up by David Freeman that does not include Direct Access. Christian Yoder and Steve Hall are reviewing the contracts to analyze any ""out clauses"" that the buyer and/or the seller might have under the contract provisions. (My cursory review of the contracts suggests that ""outs"" for the state are minimal or nonexistent.) In addition, we've started batting around ideas about how the State might reform the contracts. All this said, want to let everyone know that we have made it extremely clear that Enron fundamentally opposes any and all attempts to unilaterally abrogate anyone's contract rights. We'd like to have a quick call tomorrow (30-60 minutes) to brainstorm some options that we can offer Hertzberg to handle the contracts and keep the core/noncore solution alive. We'd like to try to have the the call at 1 PM PDT. Please let me know if this works for you, and if it doesn't, please let me know if there's a time after 1 PM PDT that works for you.

Once again there would be a CTC type recovery period but there would not be the risk that the market price must stay below a fixed price for the stranded costs to be recovered.

Subject: Call to Discuss Possible Options to Mitigate Effect of DWR Contracts--Privileged and Confidential Sensitivity: Confidential PLEASE KEEP THIS NOTE, AND THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE NOTE CONFIDENTIAL. As folks are aware, we have been engaged in closed-door negotiations for the past two weeks regarding a possible market-based solution to California's electricity crisis. In the room are the major large customer groups, environmentalists, small customers (TURN), Independent Energy Producers, labor, the Western States Petroleum Association, and Enron. The negotiations were convened by the Speaker of the Assembly (Bob Hertzberg). When Hertzberg convened the meeting, he told the parties that he wanted to achieve a core/noncore structure, similar to the structure in place in California's gas market (i.e., large customers are required to buy gas from the market, with Direct Access available to all other customers). In effect, ""core"" customers (rez and small business) would be served by the utilities' retained generating assets and QF contracts; and large customers would go to market. The core/noncore structure would begin 1.1.03. The negotiating group has struggled over the past two weeks, but is close devising a framework for core/noncore in Californis (but who pays for the utilities' past debts and the costs of DWR power purchased between January and today remain very contentious). Unfortunately, with the release of the information regarding the DWR contracts last Friday, it is now clear that achieving a core/noncore structure will be very difficult unless something is done to mitigate the contracts. The problem is that, if core is served by utility gen and QFs, and large customers are in the market, there is no (or very little) need for the DWR contracts. Instead, they look like a signficant stranded cost. Hertzberg and the negotiating group are looking to Enron for creative ways to address ""the DWR contract problem"" in order to prevent the contracts from 1) killing the core/noncore deal and 2) forcing California to accept a structure focused on a state power authority headed-up by David Freeman that does not include Direct Access. Christian Yoder and Steve Hall are reviewing the contracts to analyze any ""out clauses"" that the buyer and/or the seller might have under the contract provisions. (My cursory review of the contracts suggests that ""outs"" for the state are minimal or nonexistent.) In addition, we've started batting around ideas about how the State might reform the contracts. All this said, want to let everyone know that we have made it extremely clear that Enron fundamentally opposes any and all attempts to unilaterally abrogate anyone's contract rights. We'd like to have a quick call tomorrow (30-60 minutes) to brainstorm some options that we can offer Hertzberg to handle the contracts and keep the core/noncore solution alive. We'd like to try to have the the call at 1 PM PDT. Please let me know if this works for you, and if it doesn't, please let me know if there's a time after 1 PM PDT that works for you. Thanks, Jeff"

FYI--this new schedule was discussed a lot last week, and apparently was a big part of the meeting that occured with Davis' people and Angelides last Thursday nite. It was a move to buy time to try and get a comprehensive settlement in place in the legislature (i.e., core/noncore). In addition to buying time to save Direct Access, it also gives Angelides more time to get the bonds lined up, which seems to be an increasingly challenging task---there's growing speculation that the issuance will be much more difficult than Angelides has thus far let on. That said, I need to check around, but there is some chance that the plan/agreement is that the PUC decisions would go out well in advance of August (with effective date being August), which would then provide enough time to let the expedited ""appeals process"" under (SB37?) run its course in time for the issuance in Sept/Oct. In short, we'll need to remain vigilant energized because there's a chance that the decisions to which Angelides refers in the memo could be up at the Commission sooner rather than later.

Redding (PS, NE) (E-mail); Mike Florio (E-mail) Subject: Bond Leg Language, etc. Greetings: Hope everyone had a pleasant 4th. I've read the respective Burton and Hertzberg language on amending AB 1X. The Burton language looks cleaner and simpler, though there may be reasons to include some of the Hertzberg language, too. I'm proposing to the group the following as potential amendments to the bond bill. I would appreciate your feedback. The amendments would be as follows: Customers who were on Direct Access when DWR started buying power (Jan. 17th?), and are still on Direct Access when the bill passes, should be exempt from paying for the bonds. In short, customers should not be forced to pay for power twice--once from their ESP, and once from DWR. Since these customers receive power services from their ESP, they never consumed DWR power in the first place and it wouldn't be fair to require them to pay for it. Customers who have been utility customers since DWR started buying power but subsequently switched to Direct Access should only pay for power provided by DWR that they actually consumed, no more and no less. For example, if a customer was a utility customer when DWR started buying power but switched to Direct Access on May 1st, then the customer would only be responsible for reimbursing DWR for power deliveries that took place from Jan. 17th thru April 30th. I believe that we agreed on these concepts during the negotiations that took place over the past 4-5 weeks. Or if we didn't explicitly agree during the talks, they seem to be principles on which we ought to be able to agree pretty easily now. And rather than leave the issue hanging, which can create unnecessary and costly uncertainty for customers, I suggest that we include very clear and simple legislative language in the bond bill clarifying what customers' obligations are. Your thoughts are appreciated. In addition, we have talked quite a bit about providing customers with incentives in the attempt to get California out of the energy hole that it finds itself in. Providing (20KW and above) customers with an incentive to switch to Direct Access as soon as possible could 1) reduce the net short position that the state (and ultimately consumers) have to finance, thereby reducing spot purchases and price volatility, 2) reduce electricity purchasing costs, and 3) reduce the burden on the state budget. With this in mind, I'm also proposing that the group consider an amendment to the bond bill that would exempt from bond charges any customer that switches to Direct Access by September 1st. Finally, it seems odd that the language directing the PUC to suspend Direct Access is still in the bill. If a dedicated rate component is created, that seems to eliminate altogether the need to suspend Direct Access. And if that's the case, would it make sense to delete that language from the bill?

Redding (PS, NE) (E-mail); Mike Florio (E-mail) Subject: Bond Leg Language, etc. Greetings: Hope everyone had a pleasant 4th. I've read the respective Burton and Hertzberg language on amending AB 1X. The Burton language looks cleaner and simpler, though there may be reasons to include some of the Hertzberg language, too. I'm proposing to the group the following as potential amendments to the bond bill. I would appreciate your feedback. The amendments would be as follows: Customers who were on Direct Access when DWR started buying power (Jan. 17th?), and are still on Direct Access when the bill passes, should be exempt from paying for the bonds. In short, customers should not be forced to pay for power twice--once from their ESP, and once from DWR. Since these customers receive power services from their ESP, they never consumed DWR power in the first place and it wouldn't be fair to require them to pay for it. Customers who have been utility customers since DWR started buying power but subsequently switched to Direct Access should only pay for power provided by DWR that they actually consumed, no more and no less. For example, if a customer was a utility customer when DWR started buying power but switched to Direct Access on May 1st, then the customer would only be responsible for reimbursing DWR for power deliveries that took place from Jan. 17th thru April 30th.

Duque and Richard A. Bilas, dissenting: One could say that this order is consistent with the Administration's present third world country mentality. We are punishing the very consumers and providers who made a commitment to ensuring electric restructuring did work by adding a demand retail component to cure the dysfunctions in the wholesale market. We are not convinced that the Department of Water Resources (DWR) bond ratings depend on killing direct access. This notion is a scare tactic and a smoke screen. Direct access comprises such a small percentage of overall demand that it cannot reasonably be seen to be a threat to the sale of the bonds. Direct Access should be seen as a benefit to DWR. It would decrease the amount of the utilities net short obligations and relieve DWR from its power purchasing responsibilities sooner. Something else is going on here. We think that the DWR does not want direct access because if the public is presented with alternatives, it will make DWR's purchasing mistakes abundantly clear. The Commission should be holding hearings to test the assertions being made by DWR, Finance and the Treasurer. Instead, the Commission is making an ill informed, panicked decision to act now and study the repercussions later. DWR and the bonds should not be threatened by direct access if DWR is making prudent energy purchases. Only if DWR's contracts are too expensive, relative to market, will customers seek shelter in lower direct access prices. Indeed, retaining direct access as a way to send price signals to consumers may be the only way to place pressure on DWR to make more prudent purchases. This is a very important consideration since AB 1X prevents us from engaging in any prudency review of the DWR costs to be passed through to ratepayers in order to repay the bonds. If there is no yardstick, how can anyone measure DWR performance? The answer is, one can't, unless SB 18xx is signed into law. We think that additional review of these issues, before suspending direct access, would have produced a more sound decision in the long run. For these reasons we must respectfully dissent. /s/ HENRY M. DUQUE /s/ RICHARD A. BILAS Henry M. Duque Richard A.

Duque and Richard A. Bilas, dissenting: One could say that this order is consistent with the Administration's present third world country mentality. We are punishing the very consumers and providers who made a commitment to ensuring electric restructuring did work by adding a demand retail component to cure the dysfunctions in the wholesale market. We are not convinced that the Department of Water Resources (DWR) bond ratings depend on killing direct access. This notion is a scare tactic and a smoke screen. Direct access comprises such a small percentage of overall demand that it cannot reasonably be seen to be a threat to the sale of the bonds. Direct Access should be seen as a benefit to DWR. It would decrease the amount of the utilities net short obligations and relieve DWR from its power purchasing responsibilities sooner. Something else is going on here. We think that the DWR does not want direct access because if the public is presented with alternatives, it will make DWR's purchasing mistakes abundantly clear. The Commission should be holding hearings to test the assertions being made by DWR, Finance and the Treasurer. Instead, the Commission is making an ill informed, panicked decision to act now and study the repercussions later. DWR and the bonds should not be threatened by direct access if DWR is making prudent energy purchases. Only if DWR's contracts are too expensive, relative to market, will customers seek shelter in lower direct access prices. Indeed, retaining direct access as a way to send price signals to consumers may be the only way to place pressure on DWR to make more prudent purchases. This is a very important consideration since AB 1X prevents us from engaging in any prudency review of the DWR costs to be passed through to ratepayers in order to repay the bonds. If there is no yardstick, how can anyone measure DWR performance? The answer is, one can't, unless SB 18xx is signed into law. We think that additional review of these issues, before suspending direct access, would have produced a more sound decision in the long run. For these reasons we must respectfully dissent. /s/ HENRY M. DUQUE /s/ RICHARD A. BILAS Henry M. Duque Richard A. Bilas Commissioner Commissioner September 20, 2001 ********************************************************************** This e-mail is the property of Enron Corp. and/or its relevant affiliate and may contain confidential and privileged material for the sole use of the intended recipient (s).

As Hedy indicated before, with the Republicans not willing to vote for the bill, liberal Democrats crafted 11 new amendments which they felt were necessary in order to garner their votes. Clearly there was no consensus among committee members or leadership on the amendments in question and the business community was up in arms. Amid the confusion, Hertzberg effectively ordered the hearing canceled. They intend to hear the bill again on Monday."

Work will be done over the weekend to put the core/noncore proposal in legislative language. (We will be in the room.)

IZUMI Mr. Izumi is a senior fellow in California Studies at the San Francisco- based Pacific Research Institute. On the surface, things seem to be going pretty good for Gov. Gray Davis with regard to California's electricity crisis. The governor has scored some nice publicity by switching on some new power plants. The weather has been unseasonably cool. His poll numbers are edging back up. Yet beneath this optimistic picture lie troubling problems. For example, Davis's argument that out-of-state power generators are responsible for the electricity crisis has been falling apart. For months, Davis has been claiming that private generators have overcharged California by $8.9 billion and demanded that this amount be refunded to the state. However, after a two-week mediation between state officials and the generators, Curtis Wagner, the federal government's chief energy regulatory judge, rebuked Davis's claim saying that such a huge overcharge ""has not and cannot be substantiated."" Further, while the generators may be liable to refund a much smaller amount to the state, perhaps $1 billion, Wagner said that generators are owed more money by the state than they owe the state in refunds: ""Can a cash refund be required where a much larger amount is due the seller? The chief judge thinks not."" Davis reacted to the judge's ruling by calling it a ""raw deal"" and by urging the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to ignore the lack of evidence and the judge's conclusions and to ""step up and provide the refunds we've asked for."" Davis's position, as usual, is motivated purely by politics. Indeed, Dan Walters of the Sacramento Bee says that Davis is operating in a ""melodramatic virtual world"" de-linked from reality. Davis's blame-the-generators argument took another body blow when newly released documents showed that, on average, major out-of-state power companies such as Enron, Duke, Dynergy and Mirant charged less than the average prices paid by the state during the first three months of the year. California government utilities, on the other hand, such as the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD), charged the state much more for electricity than the out-of-state generators. For example, while Texas-based Enron, a favorite Davis whipping boy, charged an average $181 per megawatt hour, SMUD charged an average $330 per megawatt hour. Davis responded to this revelation in typical political fashion. A Davis spokesman said that the governor had expressed his anger at ""the generators who wear cowboy hats"" and that ""just because there are other entities that are charging us more doesn't change the fact that we are getting ripped off by companies from Houston, Tulsa, Atlanta or Charlotte."" Yet, for all Davis' feigned indignation about consumers being ripped off, it turns out that he and his regulators are poised to ensure that business consumers are ripped off by state government. Davis has signed $43 billion in ill-advised long-term purchase contracts at rates above-market-price. The state must, therefore, ensure that enough business customers remain in the current state-controlled distribution system to pay for high-priced state power purchases. This is especially important to Davis since the high prices are borne disproportionately by business. Thus, Davis' regulators are set to eliminate ""direct access,"" which allows businesses to shop for cheaper power. Who's the real gouger? No matter how much Davis points the finger, Californians are paying dearly for his political opportunism and bad policies.",4363,dunno. didn't say in the clips that miyung sent around.

Further, while the generators may be liable to refund a much smaller amount to the state, perhaps $1 billion, Wagner said that generators are owed more money by the state than they owe the state in refunds: ""Can a cash refund be required where a much larger amount is due the seller? The chief judge thinks not."" Davis reacted to the judge's ruling by calling it a ""raw deal"" and by urging the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to ignore the lack of evidence and the judge's conclusions and to ""step up and provide the refunds we've asked for."" Davis's position, as usual, is motivated purely by politics. Indeed, Dan Walters of the Sacramento Bee says that Davis is operating in a ""melodramatic virtual world"" de-linked from reality. Davis's blame-the-generators argument took another body blow when newly released documents showed that, on average, major out-of-state power companies such as Enron, Duke, Dynergy and Mirant charged less than the average prices paid by the state during the first three months of the year. California government utilities, on the other hand, such as the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD), charged the state much more for electricity than the out-of-state generators. For example, while Texas-based Enron, a favorite Davis whipping boy, charged an average $181 per megawatt hour, SMUD charged an average $330 per megawatt hour. Davis responded to this revelation in typical political fashion. A Davis spokesman said that the governor had expressed his anger at ""the generators who wear cowboy hats"" and that ""just because there are other entities that are charging us more doesn't change the fact that we are getting ripped off by companies from Houston, Tulsa, Atlanta or Charlotte."" Yet, for all Davis' feigned indignation about consumers being ripped off, it turns out that he and his regulators are poised to ensure that business consumers are ripped off by state government. Davis has signed $43 billion in ill-advised long-term purchase contracts at rates above-market-price. The state must, therefore, ensure that enough business customers remain in the current state-controlled distribution system to pay for high-priced state power purchases. This is especially important to Davis since the high prices are borne disproportionately by business. Thus, Davis' regulators are set to eliminate ""direct access,"" which allows businesses to shop for cheaper power. Who's the real gouger? No matter how much Davis points the finger, Californians are paying dearly for his political opportunism and bad policies."

The numbers are illustrative only.

(Edison is clearly lobbying the PUC to get DA customers to pay for these costs.) I recommended strongly that he de-link issues 1 and 2 above from the issue of paying us ASAP what they owe us for negative CTC. He agreed.

We thought, instead, that an observer might be appropriate. Jeff mentioned the new firm we hired as a possibility. I have child care duties in the morning and a WPF Board meeting from 9 - 3.

There are two pending draft decisions at this time, the first is the proposed decision of ALJ Barnett (Item H-7 on the last agenda) which was modified by a changed version submitted by Pres. Lynch at 2:45 pm on 9-5-01, the day before the last meeting. This version indicated that direct access was suspended as of the date of the order (which would have been Sept. 6) and states in another ordering paragraph that the utilities are to advise their customers that the suspension is effective Sept. 6, 2001, specifically naming that date. This order would have been interpreted to suspend direct access as of Sept. 6 if it had been voted out that day. The other item, Agenda Item H-7A on the last agenda, is the Bilas alternate decision which calls for hearings to determine the impact of direct access on the issuance of bonds, and does not suspend direct access at this time. Please be advised that the suspension date contained in H-7 can and probably will be changed before the orders are considered at the CPUC meeting on Sept. 20. Either the Sept 6 date will be changed to the 20th of Sept., or some other specific date could be inserted at all the locations in the order dealing with the suspension date. All that is required to make this change is the distribution of a changed page on the Escutia table before the Commission meeting. Thus, it is important for all direct access supporters to continue to urge the Commission, especially Commissioner Brown, to support a suspension date later than Sept. 6, because it is so easy for the date to be altered under Commission procedures.

If approved, SDG&E would be authorized to transfer a $104 million overcollection in its TCBA to its Energy Rate Ceiling Revenue Shortfall Account (the account established to record the revenue shortfall from the implementation of AB 265). The $104 million represents the overcollection in utility retained generation revenues allocated to customers which did not come under the AB 265 rate ceiling. That group would include direct access customers. SDG&E's rationale for the transfer is that it is the legislature's intent that 100% of SDG&E's retained generation be used to serve its 100 kW and below customers (i.e., the AB 265 customers). SDG&E had advanced this theory in its recent rate design case. It was opposed by several groups and has not been ruled on by the Commission. Protests on this advice filing are due August 6th.

If approved, SDG&E would be authorized to transfer a $104 million overcollection in its TCBA to its Energy Rate Ceiling Revenue Shortfall Account (the account established to record the revenue shortfall from the implementation of AB 265). The $104 million represents the overcollection in utility retained generation revenues allocated to customers which did not come under the AB 265 rate ceiling. That group would include direct access customers. SDG&E's rationale for the transfer is that it is the legislature's intent that 100% of SDG&E's retained generation be used to serve its 100 kW and below customers (i.e., the AB 265 customers). SDG&E had advanced this theory in its recent rate design case. It was opposed by several groups and has not been ruled on by the Commission. Protests on this advice filing are due August 6th. Please let me know if Enron is interested in protesting.

A DASR can only be processed if the customer name appears on the ESP List submitted to the UDCs on October 5, 2001. 2. In order to submit an ESP List the ESP must have a valid ESP/UDC Service Agreement as of September 20, 2001 and , for ESPs serving small customers, they must have in effect a valid Commission registration as of September 20, 2001. 3. For a DASR to be processed for a residential or small commercial customer account, the ESP must be able to demonstrate that the required third party verification took place prior to September 20, 2001. 4. Customers should not be allowed to switch from one ESP to another after September 20 unless the new ESP had a valid ESP- customer contract in place on or before Sept. 20th. 5. Seamless moves within a UDC's service territory will be allowed. 6. For customers on bundled service as of September 20, 2001 (but still under a DA contract), the UDCs are proposing not to allow such customers to process DASRs even if their names are on the October 5 list. 7. If all accounts of one ESP transferred to another as a result of a merger, then the situation is okay because no new DASR would be required; requests for one customer to switch from one ESP to another only allowed if the new ESP-customer relationship had a contract prior to Sept. 20, 2001. 8. Changes in customer identity allowed on case by case basis (e.g., if a customer changes its type of business it would not be allowed). 9. One customer can not transfer or assign its direct access service rights to another. 10. Processing of DASRs submitted for customers who attempt to opt into a community aggregation program after the suspension date should not be allowed. In addition to the above, the UDCs proposed three additional options for implementing the suspension. 1. The Commission should impose a DASR cut-off date (received and accepted). 2. If the Commission does not impose a strict DASR cut off, it should require that any ESP which wishes to have a DASR processed after the cut off to submit their account specific DASR information and ESP contract to the Commission along with an explanation of why the customer is eligible to receive DA. The UDC will not process the DASR until it receives an okay from the Commission. 3.

Highlights from today's CPUC meeting. It is still in progress, with few energy items remaining. Regular results memo to follow. CPUC opens new rulemaking to return to ""integrated resource planning"" with contemplation of process that sounds much like the discredited Biennial Resource Plan Update (BRPU) proceeding. Clearly contemplates utility construction of new generation projects, but also calls for life-cycle cost analysis of all options, including new asset construction, power purchase agreements, conservation, transmission, etc. CPUC rejects new interstate transmission facilities as not needed for reliability purposes (lines to NV, AZ and MX). Will begin new phase re economic projects. CPUC rejects request for clarification regarding QF contract amendments. Parties had requested clarification from CPUC decision based on language in Admin Law Judge (ALJ) ruling that stated extensions could go forward until the Commission acts. CPUC states that parties remain free to negotiation changes, but that they must move forward on ordinary review process. This decision primarily undermines QF contract amendments with SCE's. CPUC rejects PG&E's call for market valuation of retained generation. PG&E argued that CPUC must use market value of retained assets to set cost of service rates. CPUC rejects argument. Duque will concur, but notes that there are outstanding issues including the likelihood that CPUC will fail to meet statutory deadline to market value retained assets, and fact that PG&E still has stranded cost recovery rights that require market valuation. It is also unclear, notwithstanding the CPUC settlement with SCE, how post-transitions period costs will be recovered per that agreement. -- Andrew Brown Sacramento, CA andybrwn@earthlink.net",5855,"The generators are going to go nuts over this.

We will provide additional information on the OII as soon as it becomes available. -----Original Message----- From: Andy Brown [mailto:abb@eslawfirm.com] Sent: Thursday, October 25, 2001 10:36 AM To: Steven Kelly; doug kerner; Jan Smutny-Jones Subject: highlights from CPUC meeting Importance: High FYI. Highlights from today's CPUC meeting. It is still in progress, with few energy items remaining. Regular results memo to follow. CPUC opens new rulemaking to return to ""integrated resource planning"" with contemplation of process that sounds much like the discredited Biennial Resource Plan Update (BRPU) proceeding. Clearly contemplates utility construction of new generation projects, but also calls for life-cycle cost analysis of all options, including new asset construction, power purchase agreements, conservation, transmission, etc. CPUC rejects new interstate transmission facilities as not needed for reliability purposes (lines to NV, AZ and MX). Will begin new phase re economic projects. CPUC rejects request for clarification regarding QF contract amendments. Parties had requested clarification from CPUC decision based on language in Admin Law Judge (ALJ) ruling that stated extensions could go forward until the Commission acts. CPUC states that parties remain free to negotiation changes, but that they must move forward on ordinary review process. This decision primarily undermines QF contract amendments with SCE's. CPUC rejects PG&E's call for market valuation of retained generation. PG&E argued that CPUC must use market value of retained assets to set cost of service rates. CPUC rejects argument. Duque will concur, but notes that there are outstanding issues including the likelihood that CPUC will fail to meet statutory deadline to market value retained assets, and fact that PG&E still has stranded cost recovery rights that require market valuation. It is also unclear, notwithstanding the CPUC settlement with SCE, how post-transitions period costs will be recovered per that agreement. -- Andrew Brown Sacramento, CA andybrwn@earthlink.net"

The bond sale stalled last week when the California Public Utilities Commission voted 4-1 against a plan to repay the state's power costs using utility rates. The commissioners favor another approach, opposed by Davis, that would give them more authority over the state's $43 billion of power contracts. Some commissioners ``would probably be amenable to the rate agreement if there was movement on the governor's part to renegotiate those contracts,'' said Geoffrey Brown, who was appointed to the PUC by Davis. ``We're not just sitting around waiting for the sky to fall. There's got to be some give here.'' Moody's Investors Service on Friday said California's $31.6 billion of debt may be downgraded for the second time this year, in part because of the delayed bond sale. California's budget deficit in fiscal 2003 may reach $9.3 billion if energy costs aren't repaid, state Treasurer Philip Angelides said. The state has spent $10.4 billion since January buying electricity on behalf of PG&E Corp. and Edison International utilities, which are insolvent. Davis `Willing to Discuss' ``It takes two to tango and we are certainly willing to discuss the contracts,'' said Steve Maviglio, the governor's spokesman. Davis will consider Brown's offer, ``especially in context'' of any refunds from generators that may be ordered, Maviglio said. State officials claim power generators have charged too much, and are asking federal regulators to order refunds. Power generators are ``willing to discuss it, but I wouldn't want anybody to have any false promise or hope that any enormous change will come from this,'' said Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, a group representing power sellers. Any companies willing to talk ``might want something else in return, and who knows what that might be.'' The planned bond sale, the largest municipal debt sale in U.S. history, would repay the state's general fund for a $6.1 billion power loan and cover other power costs. The sale has been delayed by the disagreements among state leaders. `A Blank Check' Under state law, the PUC is required to provide enough revenue from consumer rates to meet the bond payments and cover power contracts. The Department of Water Resources, the state agency buying the power, has sole authority to determine its revenue needs. PUC President Loretta Lynch and others said an irrevocable financing order would make it difficult for the state to renegotiate power contracts. They also said the DWR has been given too much authority. In the past, the PUC has set utility rates. ``It gives a blank check to the DWR for anything that they want to do going forward,'' said California Senate President Pro Tempore John Burton. The commissioners favor a plan to back the bonds with a surcharge on utility customers' bills. The proposal would let the PUC review the water department's revenue requirements and require a public hearing on the allocation of costs among the utilities. Davis opposes that plan. ``It's dead on arrival. It's still going to be vetoed,'' said Maviglio. The governor has until Sunday to sign or veto all the bills sent to him during the last session. The new plan would expose the state to breach-of-contract claims, the governor's office said in a statement last week. The state agreed with power generators to pay energy contracts before repaying the bonds. Making a change now ``would eliminate the security on which the power sellers relied'' the governor's office said in the statement. Critics of the long-term power contracts say the state's economy will be hurt by above-market costs for years to come. No matter which approach the state takes, ``the government ought to try to renegotiate the contracts anyway,'' Burton said. ``And some of the generators have said they're willing to do it.''",4734,Amusing if you're way up there in Portland....,"-----Original Message----- From: Calger, Christopher F.

Have not changed much since my earlier e-mail to you, except that Bowen bill now includes a fee to the alternate provider when a customer is ""involuntarily returned"" to the utility. Language is attached. - SB 27xx - mockup.doc Right now, this legislation is awaiting the outcome of negotiations involving SCE and other parties (Jeff Dasovich is our rep). Speaker Hertzberg and Senator Burton both have endorsed these negotiations and promised to support agreements the parties reach. Jeff tells me this morning they are getting close to agreement on core/non-core and direct access issues but there are still major stumbling blocks, mostly surrounding the going forward DWR costs and contracts, and the issuance of bonds to pay for them. The bond guys see direct access as possible undermining the bonds. If or once agreement is reached, the expectation is that enabling legislation would be crafted that would apply California-wide. The general structure in the SCE discussion is this - By Jan 1, '03, 500 kW+ customers decide to go to market or stay with utility for a long (5 yrs+) period. Re-entry from market would be with up to 12 month notice and could require customer to pay spot market price under utility default. 20-500 kw customers would have voluntary direct access. Under 20 kw customers would have green-only voluntary direct access. Recovery for past undercollections is being negotiated, but will likely require large customers (20 kw+) to pay a disproportionate share of the costs. This may be less than definitive, but as usual, the situation is fluid. Marty and Jeremy, are you available for a Wednesday morning call with Jeff Dasovich? Also, just in case you didn't hear, the Commission is scheduled to vote on Thursday the 14th on an order that would suspend direct access under the AB1x. The expectation is that the vote will be delayed. Best information says there are not enough votes to approve direct access suspension.

I agree with Prentice's assessment (of course, I always agree with Prentice's assessment). Best, Jeff Happy Valentine's Day to all.

I suggest we get the repairs done immediately and leave the tile for later. Can you find out if he can finish before next weekend whatever needs to be done to have a fire safely? I've been planning a trip with two friends of mine from school for a long time and it would really be a bummer to have to cancel it. Thanks for working on this. Also, about the $$, mom should have put aside $10,000 from grandpa ($5,000 from me and Cameron each) that was supposed to go for replacing the roof. This is much more important, so I suggest using that money. Finally, we can get Jeff's friend Karen to help us with the tiles. We will talk to her.
