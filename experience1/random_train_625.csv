Also, gas-indexed contracts were examined on their nongas costs only. Since gas costs are a pass through on some contracts, we excluded them as a conservatism; i.e., we did not ascribe costs to the gas portion of the contracts since they will float with market costs over time. These contracts were marked to market using current, applicable curves. Finally we discounted at the LIBOR rate, which is around 4%/year. The stranded cost under these assumptions is approximately $10 billion. The spreadsheet shows the overmarket costs by contract. Note: a negative ""mark-to-market"" equals a positive stranded cost.

They responded with what they agree to, which I believe we can (and will have to) live with. I will not be attending the meeting this Thursday due to conflicts, but will be available to attend via phone. 1. TW will fund in year 2000 the installation of the necessary PG&E customer filter separators and the additional costs related to PG&E's PCB testing. action items GQC: Thoroughly review PG&E customer F/S sites and costs. Formally get agreement. Earl: Prepare a new work order for $3,000,000 naming specific sites and costs related to sampling and analysis. Note: I have requested an additional $3,000,000 for this years Capital Plan to do this work, which Bill has received verbally from Stan. 2. PG&E will lift the 250 / D limit and move to market driven conditions of up to 300 / D at Topock on May 15 with on-going monitoring to ensure no further migration of PCB's. They wish for a six month test on this condition. action item: Rich: Review formal pigging and sampling plan with Tiny and Needles Team. Rich / Larry: Increase or reinforce pigging and analysis on Topock Lateral, as well as any mainline pigging and analysis required due to Gallup increase volumes. 3.

Since I did not hear back from you, I assume that EBA was not interested. It would help us a lot in our future planning if you could perhaps help me with your reasoning. Did we approach you too late (given the Dec 4 deadline)? We required all participants to pay registration fees, was that an issue? We couldn't guarantee you a slot even if you proposed a session, was that an issue? Thanks in advance for your response. S.

(for the same lines, e.g. OC3, OC12, OC48, ...) 4. What is the upgrading cost for the different lines? (e.g. how much does it cost to upgrade) OC3 --> OC12 OC3 --> OC48 OC12 --> OC48 5. How long does it take to upgrade a line from a certain capacity to another (e.g. 1 month, 2 month, ...) ? We realize that some of these questions may ask for confidential data, in that case we would really appreciate if an order of magnitude was provided. I look forward to hearing from you.

Subject: Think you=0F2re having a bad day? Date: Wed, 17 Jan 2001 10:35:31 NEXT TIME YOU THINK YOU=0F2RE HAVING A BAD DAY: Fire authorities in California found a corpse in a burned out section of forest while assessing the damage done by a forest fire. The deceased male was dressed in a full wet suit, complete with scuba tanks on his back, flippers, and facemask. A post-mortem revealed that the person died not from burns, but from massive internal injuries. Dental records provided a positive identification. Investigators then set about to determine how a fully clad diver ended up in the middle of a forest fire. It was revealed that on the day of the fire, the person went for a diving trip off the coast some 20 miles from the forest. The fire fighters, seeking to control the fire as quickly as possible, called in a fleet of helicopters with very large dip buckets. Water was dipped from the ocean and then flown to the forest fire and emptied. You guessed it. One minute the man was making like Flipper in the Pacific, the next he was doing the breaststroke in a fire dip bucket 300 feet in the air. Apparently he extinguished exactly 5'10"" of the fire. Some days it just doesn't pay to get out of bed. This article was taken from the California Examiner, March 20, 1998. STILL THINK YOU=0F2RE HAVING A BAD DAY? A man was working on his motorcycle on his patio and his wife was in the kitchen. The man was racing the engine on the motorcycle when it accidentally slipped into gear. The man, still holding onto the handlebars, was dragged through the glass patio doors and along with the motorcycle dumped onto the floor inside the house. The wife, hearing the crash, ran into the dining room and found her husband lying on the floor, cut and bleeding, the motorcycle lying next to him, and the shattered patio door! She ran to the phone and summoned the ambulance. Because they lived on a fairly large hill, the wife went down the several flights of stairs to the street to escort the paramedics to her husband. After the ambulance arrived and transported the man to the hospital, the wife uprighted the motorcycle and pushed it outside. Since gas was spilled on the floor, the wife got bunch of napkins, blotted up most of the gasoline, and threw the napkins in the toilet. The man was treated and released to come home. Upon arriving home, he looked at the shattered patio door and the damage done to his motorcycle. He became despondent, went to the bathroom, sat down on the toilet and smoked a cigarette. After finishing the cigarette, he flipped it between his legs into the toilet bowl while seated. The wife, who was in the kitchen, heard the loud explosion and her husband screaming. She ran into the bathroom and found her husband lying on the floor. His trousers had been blown away and he was suffering burns on the buttocks, the back of his legs, and his groin. The wife again ran to the phone to call the ambulance. The very same paramedic crew was dispatched and the wife met them at the street. The paramedics loaded the husband on to the stretcher and began carrying him to the street. While they were going down the stairs to the street accompanied by the wife, one of the paramedics asked the wife how the husband had burned himself. She told them and the paramedics started laughing so hard, one of them slipped and tipped the stretcher, dumping the husband out. He fell down the remaining stairs and broke his arm. Taken from a Florida Newspaper. STILL HAVING A BAD DAY? Just remember, it could be worse..... 1. The average cost of rehabilitating a seal after the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska was $80,000! At a special ceremony, two of the most expensively saved animals were released back into the wild amid cheers and applause from onlookers. A minute later, in full view, a killer whale ate them both. 2. A psychology student in New York rented out her spare room to a carpenter in order to nag him constantly and study his reactions. After weeks of needling, he snapped and beat her with an axe leaving her brain damaged. 3. A woman came home to find her husband in the kitchen, shaking frantically with what looked like a wire running from his waist towards the electric kettle. Intending to jolt him away from the deadly current she whacked him with a handy plank of wood by the back door, breaking his arm in two places. Until that moment he had been happily listening to his new Walkman. 4. Two animal rights protesters were protesting at the cruelty of sending pigs to a slaughterhouse in Bonn Germany. Suddenly the pigs, all two thousand of them, escaped through a broken fence and stampeded, trampling the two hapless protesters to death. AND FINALLY....... 5.

You may obain a copy of this new book by completing a Forms Request and ordering Item #42629. These guidelines will also be made available electronically on the Brand Site at home.enron.com. We'd like to take this opportunity to remind all of you about the importance of maintaining a consistent look, especially with our stationery and business cards. It has come to our attention recently that some employees are having these items produced by outside vendors and are not following the established guidelines. This must stop immediately. Please use the internal resources available to you for these items. They will ensure that all guidelines are followed correctly and consistently. If you have questions on how to get these items or on the guidelines, you may contact Marge Nadasky in Corporate Identity at marge.nadasky@enron.com. One name, one company....one Enron.

Regarding the utilities, you and I know that I have had the right to shut off the utilities to a property I don't own for sometime now. I did not do that because I wanted to stay on good terms with the Kuo's while negotiating the release. I had the utilities taken out of my name yesterday. The city of seguin informs me that the meters were read yesterday and the final bill will be mailed to me next week. Then I can compute the amount that the Kuo's owe me for utilities and send them a check for the rock repairs. Please let Pauline know that she needs to go down to the city and take care of the deposit by Friday or the power may be disconnected. The utilities are already in her name. In my mind the utilities were never a bargaining chip. Rather, you and I are paying the $11,000 in exchange for the release. Regarding the transfer of ownership into a limited partnership, I will most likely be agreeable to this but I want to review all the loan documents with Jacques and ensure that there is still a personal guarantee on the two notes. I expect to have that done by Friday. I would like for her to sign the release today, but if she won't sign until I consent to the limited partnership then the release will have to wait until Friday. As far as the utilities go, I made the transfer for two reasons: 1) I need to know the amount that I have paid to net against the $11,000 and 2) I had the right to take the utilities out of my name and I didn't want the balance to get out of hand. I will call you when I am comfortable consenting to the limited partnership.

Please let Pauline know that she needs to go down to the city and take care of the deposit by Friday or the power may be disconnected. The utilities are already in her name. In my mind the utilities were never a bargaining chip. Rather, you and I are paying the $11,000 in exchange for the release. Regarding the transfer of ownership into a limited partnership, I will most likely be agreeable to this but I want to review all the loan documents with Jacques and ensure that there is still a personal guarantee on the two notes. I expect to have that done by Friday. I would like for her to sign the release today, but if she won't sign until I consent to the limited partnership then the release will have to wait until Friday. As far as the utilities go, I made the transfer for two reasons: 1) I need to know the amount that I have paid to net against the $11,000 and 2) I had the right to take the utilities out of my name and I didn't want the balance to get out of hand. I will call you when I am comfortable consenting to the limited partnership.

If you believe it to be good, and we find ourselves in a jam, I want everyone to have an understanding of the proposed process. Please think about this and realize that we may not seriously discuss this solution until the week of June 11th, when I return from vacation, at which time we can reassess the need for such a patch. (THIS IS NOT A REQUEST TO IMPLEMENT, BUT FOR DISCUSSION ONLY.) Background: Factor loadings are currently done for three separate groups, natural gas, power and liquids. There are many discussions regarding increasing the number of factors in the model and implementing PCA across the groups. It is my understanding that joint estimation is done for each group, and the correlations in that group are embedded in those factors. One critical problem we have in power, is that the desk hedges using NG, and that in the VAR simulation, the NG factors are ""pulled"" in from another factor group, i.e. the natural gas factor group, possibly causing VaR measurement issues. Additionally, in the factor loading process, one has to pre-identify potential core curves for each group. If one were to include in each group's core curve list other curves that have been previously included in other groups, one would most likely create ""factor-overkill"", thereby destroying the value-at-risk engine and reducing it to nothing. (maybe I'm a little dramatic here, but you get the point?) Idea: Introduce to the power core curve list and group, natural gas curves, so that risk engine would only use factors generated appropriately for power, and not have to borrow them from another group. Solution: To do so, Enpower would have to create (and copy 60 days worth of history) and introduce, unique but also identical, natural gas curves. These curves would be inserted to the curves utilized for creating power factors -so that the factors used for power VAR, include the appropriate NG curves (used by power traders to hedge their exposure). These NG-PWR curves would be renamed so that they are ""unique"" to that commodity group and system. Upon factors being generated, positions would have to be moved to the NG-PWR curve(s) so that Value-at-risk would pick up the new factors. (If positions are not moved, the VAR engine would pull in the factors generated in the natural gas factor loading process, not the power factor loading process...) Additionally, factors generated in other commodity groups would not be utilized in power VAR because they wouldn't have ""delta"" on them, rather the delta would be on the new NG-PWR curves, utilizing the factors appropriately generated respective to power. (For those joint calculated factors, where we assume perfect correlation, we would have to ""ensure"" that those ""curves"" stand out and are not done jointly..) I recognize that this sort of patch has the potential to become a ""legacy""?.

There are many discussions regarding increasing the number of factors in the model and implementing PCA across the groups. It is my understanding that joint estimation is done for each group, and the correlations in that group are embedded in those factors. One critical problem we have in power, is that the desk hedges using NG, and that in the VAR simulation, the NG factors are ""pulled"" in from another factor group, i.e. the natural gas factor group, possibly causing VaR measurement issues. Additionally, in the factor loading process, one has to pre-identify potential core curves for each group. If one were to include in each group's core curve list other curves that have been previously included in other groups, one would most likely create ""factor-overkill"", thereby destroying the value-at-risk engine and reducing it to nothing. (maybe I'm a little dramatic here, but you get the point?) Idea: Introduce to the power core curve list and group, natural gas curves, so that risk engine would only use factors generated appropriately for power, and not have to borrow them from another group. Solution: To do so, Enpower would have to create (and copy 60 days worth of history) and introduce, unique but also identical, natural gas curves. These curves would be inserted to the curves utilized for creating power factors -so that the factors used for power VAR, include the appropriate NG curves (used by power traders to hedge their exposure). These NG-PWR curves would be renamed so that they are ""unique"" to that commodity group and system. Upon factors being generated, positions would have to be moved to the NG-PWR curve(s) so that Value-at-risk would pick up the new factors. (If positions are not moved, the VAR engine would pull in the factors generated in the natural gas factor loading process, not the power factor loading process...) Additionally, factors generated in other commodity groups would not be utilized in power VAR because they wouldn't have ""delta"" on them, rather the delta would be on the new NG-PWR curves, utilizing the factors appropriately generated respective to power. (For those joint calculated factors, where we assume perfect correlation, we would have to ""ensure"" that those ""curves"" stand out and are not done jointly..) I recognize that this sort of patch has the potential to become a ""legacy""?. Let me know your thoughts, Frank"

And since we have access to Beverly's house, I can warm stuff up over there, so as not to get in anyone's way. I'm looking forward to seeing yall again.

We do not believe that they intend for us to be dispatrched above 220 MW. (Do we have any document which could substantiate this?) 2) Although dispatch on a merit order basis would suggest that EPE runs full time (with 300 MW available), there are practical constraints in the transmission system which will prohibit this from actually occuring. [ Please describe these constraints using some official sounding jargon but minimal detail and in particular indicate what is involved to de-bottleneck and how long this will take. I presume that Furnas is solely responsible for the corrective measures.] 3) Based on our analysis, the optimal operating approach would be to generate 220MW with one turbine and 91 MW with the other for a total of 311 if dipatched above 220 MW. If we can prove that 1) & 2) are correct or convince the lenders that they are, then I think we can suggest that fuel oil exposure is negligibe if gas is ready by April 01. We will have to see how it looks when we add the Sue Garvin flex months. Therefore, a merit order analysis is only necessary if i) our supposition about Furnas' motivations are incorrect and/or ii) the transmission problem is cleared. If this happens it would be nice to be able to predict reduced fuel utilization due to a) reduced dispatch during daily off-peak hours or seasonal impacts, b) due to scheduled outages, and c) due to managing our availabilty in such a way as to reduce fuel consumption operating losses.

This is interesting because due to the recent discoveries of cracked and leaking vessel head penetrations (like that at Oconee 3), all PWRs are required by Bulletin 2001-01 to perform inspections and provide information related to the structural integrity of the upper reactor pressure vessel head penetration nozzles to ensure the integrity of the reactor coolant system pressure boundary and to demonstrate compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. Davis-Besse, however, wants to defer this inspection/assurance information until their refueling outage in the Spring of 2002. The NRC has 4 categories of plants according to risk for penetration cracking. They are: 1. Plants that already experienced cracks (Oconee 1, 2, 3; ANO 1; Cook 2) 2. Plants that are considered with high susceptibility (Davis-Besse, and six other plants) 3. Plants that are considered with moderate susceptibility (32 plants) 4. Plants that are considered with low susceptibility So, with Davis-Besse in the high susceptible category, the NRC may require them to provide assurance requiring an inspection and therefore an outage. MEETING 2. 10/25/01 - The day after the above meeting is a meeting concerning the Pebble Bed reactor. This is the reactor type that Exelon is pushing for construction and use in the US. Exelon will be discussing with the NRC the biggest possible ""showstopper"" for the design--the graphite coolant. Graphite can burn (e.g. Chernobyl). However, pebble bed proponents say it is unlikely. The NRC should provide info on their concerns and leanings which would steer Exelon one way or another. So far this contract year, we have attended two meetings. That leaves us currently with a backlog of four meetings through this month and a rate of use of .67 meetings per month which would make the projected use for the year of about eight of the 24 meetings allowed in the contract. If we attend the above two meetings, the backlog would be down to two; the rate would be 1.33 per month; and the projected yearend total would still be only about 16. Let me know as soon as possible since meeting #1 is scheduled for tomorrow so I would need to make plans.

(""EEIM"") (which is wholly-owned by Enron North America Corp.) Brian refers below to the fact that Rey Garcia and I spoke and decided that a split of the contracts was necessary for Enron because of Mexican value-added tax concerns. At that time, however, the Enron entity that was to enter into the contract(s) was Enron North America Corp., a U.S. corporation. For several Mexican tax reasons, we advised that the appropriate Enron entity to enter into the contract(s) is EEIM, a Mexican entity. Please contact me at ext. 35777 if you have any questions.

If you want to unsplit the documents it will add additional time in excess geting a consolidation agreement completed I think. Please include Rey in your quest for closure. PS GE is now OK with the split. I need help getting closure on the Consolidation Agreement. I hope that we do not invent other issues as well."

My understanding is that his employment agreement expired on December 31, 2000 and he is not under contract currently. Please provide any wording changes as a result. We still want to be able to deduct the tax advances from any monies owed to him at the time of termination. Should we simply delete the two references in the letter to his employment agreement?

Erik, seems that it would be useful if the customer letters to Alpert could make the following points (folks please weigh in and add/subtract/modify if needed): The customer's glad to have had the option to take Direct Access service from Enron because having the opportunity to take advantage of the offer has made the customer better off. Direct Access is an extremely important option that customers need, want and should have going forward. Any ""solution"" that the Legislature comes up with must therefore include the continuation of Direct Access for all customers. As such, the Legislature should immediately fix AB 1X to make sure that Direct Access remains a permanent fixture of California's energy strategy.

Scott/Hedy/Sandi/Bev: Erik Letke heads up the retail marketing effort underway in San Diego. Marty Sunde wants Alpert to have an EES commercial contact that she can talk to in the event she has further questions, etc., He'd like Erki to be the contact person. Erik could you copy your vitals (title, contact info) to Scott and Hedy Govenar and Sandi McCubbin so they can forward along to Alpert? Erik, seems that it would be useful if the customer letters to Alpert could make the following points (folks please weigh in and add/subtract/modify if needed): The customer's glad to have had the option to take Direct Access service from Enron because having the opportunity to take advantage of the offer has made the customer better off. Direct Access is an extremely important option that customers need, want and should have going forward. Any ""solution"" that the Legislature comes up with must therefore include the continuation of Direct Access for all customers. As such, the Legislature should immediately fix AB 1X to make sure that Direct Access remains a permanent fixture of California's energy strategy. Direct Access customers should not be forced to pay for DWR's power purchase costs, since Direct Access customers aren't benefitting from those purchases. Best, Jeff Scott Govenar <sgovenar@govadv.com> 03/19/2001 04:01 PM To: Jeff Dasovich <jdasovic@enron.com> cc: Subject: Dede As discussed, customers should send letters to Dede as follows: The Honrable Dede Alpert California State Senate State Capitol, Room 5050 Sacramento, CA 95814 Interested companies should copy: ""Honorable Members of the California State Legislature"" and fax or mail me a copy for further distribution. My fax is (916) 448-0816 and my address is 1127 11th Street, Suite #400, Sacramento, CA 95814. Scott"

It sounds great at first - free lunch everyday but trust me you grow to hate it. Regardless we should go for a beer sometime soon. Give me a call and we'll go for a happy hour. x35933,"-----Original Message----- From: Vassigh, Brian Sent: Tuesday, October 02, 2001 6:01 PM To: Cuilla, Martin Subject: Que Paso Amigo Hey Martin this is Vassigh Willy D's friend.

We got our bottoms kicked--although I think we won on the credit for billing our own customers (APS wanted to credit ESPs $0.25/customer--we got the number up somewhere above the cost of postage). My recollection is simliar to Leslie's re: the asset transfer and affiliate as the PLR. It was part of the settlement. We fought the arrangement and lost.

We have much better political contacts in Arizona now; however, the contacts are with the Gov's office and not the ACC. Recall that the ACC is elected and is one of Arizona's four branches of government--i.e., the judiciary, the legislature, the executive branch and the ACC (by virtue of Arizona's constitution). APS may be pushing back a little hard here (25% by 2008), but I'd want a firm indication that there was interest in Arizona before we fight it, and I'd want a clear indication that the market wasn't competitive from a retail perspective without the PLR being 100% short. When we fought it last time, Frank Vickers and ENA had some interest in the PLR. We tried to negotiate a deal with Jack Davis to swap some power so the PLR was instaneously being served by other than APS. We were entirely unsuccessful and Vickers dropped Arizona like it had the plague. Having said all that, I'm always up for a good fight.

2343,26-03-2001 13:17:00,RE: Nitrogen facility,eugene.o'gorman@enron.com,arnold.eisenstein@enron.com,"I quickly reviewed the Engelhard technology. It may have some nice applications. Here are the issues with this nitrogen rejection technology. Adaptation of PSA technology, controls pore diameter (pd) at 3.7 A, and excludes methane which has a pd of 3.8 A and captures the nitrogen with a pd of 3.6 A. Nice feature, there is only a 15 psi pressure drop between the feed gas and the product gas for this technology. Issues At low inlet pressures or low nitrogen concentrations the methane recovery can be as low as 80% unless a recycle system is utilized. Then the recovery rate improves to greater than 90%. As the inlet pressure increases, the recovery improves to 95+% but the recycle is approx. 15%. PSA technology has operated at a 600 psig maximum pressure economically, since it uses many 300 ANSI flanges and valves. Higher pressures are achievable, but the gas recoveries costs are required to be offset the higher cost of 600 ANSI valves and flanges. The tail gas stream needs to have an economic home. This stream operates in the 7 psia to 15 psia range and has a 300 Btu/scf. If the feed gas has a high concentration of C3s and C4+ a pre treatment BPSA is required to extract the heavies for the nitrogen removal PSA. Gas impurities like CO2 or H2S each require evaluation based on feed gas analysis. Engelhard claims for 300 to 800 psia operating range, it can deliver 4% nitrogen in the residue gas and will achieve a 97.5% methane recovery for 5% nitrogen stream and the recovery falls to 90% methane for a feed stream of 25% nitrogen. This implies a recycle system is built into the design.

Their process is new technology and have only a few units in production that is available for field inspection. One unit is located in SW Colorado and reduces dehydrated gas from 18% to 3% N2. The process is called the Molecular Gate System and uses a patented mole sieve absorbent process. The process removes both nitrogen and CO2 with a pressure drop across the unit of approximately 15 psi. Some methane is lost in the regeneration process and an enriched recycle stream high in C4+ will need to be recycled requiring a small compressor unit. Estimated costs excluding a recycle compressor are about $1.7MM for a 5MMcfd unit and $2.5MM for a 15 MMcfd unit. Installation is not included in estimated costs but may vary between $100K to $200K for locations. I am investigating this process further because I feel that the benefits of nitrogen removal in the Bushton Universe might prove to be economical with satelite installations versus a common point cryogenic plant considering that NNG is currently transporting 45 - 50 MMcf of N2 per day. The removal of N2 would equate to lower O&M expenses on compression and higher heating values on the NNG system. Both would help Enron realize higher revenue potential.

In Moody's June 1999 study, Debt Recoveries for Corporate Bankruptcies, there is a graph of Firm-Level Recovery Rates by Year of Bankruptcy Resolution (as opposed to default year). Reading from the graph finds: As the data above is based on resolution year, the same study finds the average length of time spent in bankruptcy is 1.30 years (median 1.15 years and standard deviation of 1.20 years). The interesting point is the slide in recovery value 1996 to 1998. One would wonder if the mix of high-yield issuance slanted towards the tech companies would yield lower recoveries (quick technological obsolescence--little tangible recovery value).

We appreciate your initial support of the system and would like to solicit your input on some system details that will be custom to the Corp. deployment and may be used eventually for other business units' standards. Bob Butts has approved the following request limits for Corp. Accounting, and we need to get your ""OK"" as well for implementation. Please call me at x33896 if you have any questions or would like to discuss this proposal. Request limits: The system allows setup of graduated dollar limits for order amounts based on job classification, which are listed below, with some examples of items that might fit within each limit. Requests with totals below these limits would flow through the system without any further authorization required. Exceptions to these levels can be made on an individual basis, and those individuals will be identified as we get closer to implementation. Level 1 Clerks/Sr. Clerks $250 Routine office supplies, beverages, pager, computer keyboard Level 2 Admins/Specialists $500 Small furniture, larger supply orders, palm pilot Level 3 Sr. Specialist $5,00 Computer, fax machine, furniture Level 4 Manager $25,000 Level 5 Director/Sr. Director $100,000 Level 6 Vice President $250,000 Level 7 Managing Director $500,000 Level 8 EVP $1.0M Please note that these amounts fall within the Enron standards for invoice approval authority. In our meetings with Stakeholders and Change Agents, we got a clear message that lower ordering authorization was preferable. Approval Flow: The system allows approval flow to be customized to each department. For example, Public Affairs could require a request for $650 placed by a clerk to flow first to an Admin for approval, then to a Sr. Specialist or higher for final issuance. The Accounting department could require a request for $650 placed by a clerk to go directly to a Director for the first level of approval. Under the limits proposed below, a $650 request by a Sr. Specialist would not be routed, as it would fall under the specified ordering authorized level. As we get closer to the implementation date, we will work with the designated Stakeholders to design the approval flow for your departments. Controls: As with any system, a concentrated effort can bypass built-in controls. As a control mechanism, we've proposed that SAP generate a periodic report so that cost center owners can conveniently track ordering activity. The team is working on the best way to generate and deliver this report. I appreciate your ""OK"" on the above, or any feedback you might have.

Thanks! I'm out of the office, but am monitoring my e-mail. Regards, Elizabeth Linnell ----- Forwarded by Elizabeth Linnell/NA/Enron on 04/16/2001 03:24 AM ----- Elizabeth Linnell 04/06/2001 09:27 AM To: James Derrick/Enron@EnronXGate, Rick Buy/Enron@EnronXGate, Andrew S Fastow/Enron@EnronXGate, Bill Donovan/EPSC/HOU/ECT@ECT, Cindy Olson/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc: Subject: iBuyit - Need your input The Corp. design of the iBuyit system is well underway. We appreciate your initial support of the system and would like to solicit your input on some system details that will be custom to the Corp. deployment and may be used eventually for other business units' standards. Bob Butts has approved the following request limits for Corp. Accounting, and we need to get your ""OK"" as well for implementation. Please call me at x33896 if you have any questions or would like to discuss this proposal. Request limits: The system allows setup of graduated dollar limits for order amounts based on job classification, which are listed below, with some examples of items that might fit within each limit. Requests with totals below these limits would flow through the system without any further authorization required. Exceptions to these levels can be made on an individual basis, and those individuals will be identified as we get closer to implementation. Level 1 Clerks/Sr. Clerks $250 Routine office supplies, beverages, pager, computer keyboard Level 2 Admins/Specialists $500 Small furniture, larger supply orders, palm pilot Level 3 Sr. Specialist $5,00 Computer, fax machine, furniture Level 4 Manager $25,000 Level 5 Director/Sr. Director $100,000 Level 6 Vice President $250,000 Level 7 Managing Director $500,000 Level 8 EVP $1.0M Please note that these amounts fall within the Enron standards for invoice approval authority. In our meetings with Stakeholders and Change Agents, we got a clear message that lower ordering authorization was preferable. Approval Flow: The system allows approval flow to be customized to each department. For example, Public Affairs could require a request for $650 placed by a clerk to flow first to an Admin for approval, then to a Sr. Specialist or higher for final issuance. The Accounting department could require a request for $650 placed by a clerk to go directly to a Director for the first level of approval. Under the limits proposed below, a $650 request by a Sr. Specialist would not be routed, as it would fall under the specified ordering authorized level. As we get closer to the implementation date, we will work with the designated Stakeholders to design the approval flow for your departments. Controls: As with any system, a concentrated effort can bypass built-in controls. As a control mechanism, we've proposed that SAP generate a periodic report so that cost center owners can conveniently track ordering activity. The team is working on the best way to generate and deliver this report. I appreciate your ""OK"" on the above, or any feedback you might have. Regards, Elizabeth Linnell"

Would the Norfolk location fill the UI short as well so we could potentially get a double benefit? -----Original Message----- From: Llodra, John Sent: Friday, July 13, 2001 10:10 AM To: Duran, W. David; Presto, Kevin M.; Davis, Mark Dana Cc: Staines, Dan Subject: NU CT-Long-Island Transmission Opportunity Dan Staines and I met with NU's Transmission Business Unit yesterday to discuss their proposed transmission project connecting CT and Long Island. In a nutshell, here are the details on the project (Dan can speak to greater technical details): Run from Norwalk Harbor (CT) to Oyster Bay area of Long Island (Shore Rd substation) Minimum capacity of 330 MW; are considering approximate doubling of the capacity Will be HVDC line, thereby facilitating flows in either direction and flexible scheduling They have started siting process (formal filing to be made this fall) and have commitments from key vendors (production slots secured, etc.) In order for the line to be workable, one of two things needs to happen: (1) tansmission into the Southwest CT area needs to be beefed up; or (2) new generation needs to be placed at Norwalk Harbor. As such, NU has proposed upgrades to the transmission system into Southweast CT (they are confident these upgrades can be accomplished without too much difficulty; Dan believes it will be difficult) They are planning on holding an ""open season"" for the transmission capacity (much as gas pipelines do), and are looking to get proposals by Aug 10, 2001. In addition to basic fixed MW block purchase bids for a term of the bidder's preference (e.g., 100 MW for 5 years), they are interested in seeing alternative creative proposals. The main objective of the open season is to secure sufficient transmission capacity sales contracts to get this project financed and built. My hunch is that while they may get some healthy interest in capacity purchases, the bids will likely be shorter-term plays on the current congestion differential between CT and Long Island, and that they probably will not get a whole lot of long-term purchase bids to support raising project debt. As such, I was thinking we might offer them a proposal something like the following: Enron injects some level of debt or mezzanine funding to enable the project to lever up In return, Enron receives either or both of: (1) series of options to acquire firm (physical or financial) capacity rights on the line for multiple periods of, say, 5 years each; or (2) option to acquire an equity position in the line The options on the line could be made more valuable if we locked in optionality to develop new CCGT generation at or near Norwalk Harbor, thereby having the ability to deliver CC economics into the Long Island market (I was speaking to CMEEC, and they indicate they have a site in the Norwalk area they want to develop) What do you all think of this concept? Do we have a desire to enter into a long-term purchase or option position on rights to the line?

David; Presto, Kevin M.; Davis, Mark Dana Cc: Staines, Dan Subject: NU CT-Long-Island Transmission Opportunity Dan Staines and I met with NU's Transmission Business Unit yesterday to discuss their proposed transmission project connecting CT and Long Island. In a nutshell, here are the details on the project (Dan can speak to greater technical details): Run from Norwalk Harbor (CT) to Oyster Bay area of Long Island (Shore Rd substation) Minimum capacity of 330 MW; are considering approximate doubling of the capacity Will be HVDC line, thereby facilitating flows in either direction and flexible scheduling They have started siting process (formal filing to be made this fall) and have commitments from key vendors (production slots secured, etc.) In order for the line to be workable, one of two things needs to happen: (1) tansmission into the Southwest CT area needs to be beefed up; or (2) new generation needs to be placed at Norwalk Harbor. As such, NU has proposed upgrades to the transmission system into Southweast CT (they are confident these upgrades can be accomplished without too much difficulty; Dan believes it will be difficult) They are planning on holding an ""open season"" for the transmission capacity (much as gas pipelines do), and are looking to get proposals by Aug 10, 2001. In addition to basic fixed MW block purchase bids for a term of the bidder's preference (e.g., 100 MW for 5 years), they are interested in seeing alternative creative proposals. The main objective of the open season is to secure sufficient transmission capacity sales contracts to get this project financed and built. My hunch is that while they may get some healthy interest in capacity purchases, the bids will likely be shorter-term plays on the current congestion differential between CT and Long Island, and that they probably will not get a whole lot of long-term purchase bids to support raising project debt. As such, I was thinking we might offer them a proposal something like the following: Enron injects some level of debt or mezzanine funding to enable the project to lever up In return, Enron receives either or both of: (1) series of options to acquire firm (physical or financial) capacity rights on the line for multiple periods of, say, 5 years each; or (2) option to acquire an equity position in the line The options on the line could be made more valuable if we locked in optionality to develop new CCGT generation at or near Norwalk Harbor, thereby having the ability to deliver CC economics into the Long Island market (I was speaking to CMEEC, and they indicate they have a site in the Norwalk area they want to develop) What do you all think of this concept?

Here's a brief rundown on what's been happening. In the United Kingdom PADI received some great exposure for the PADI Seal Team Program when the BBC's children television series Blue Peter did a whole segment on the Scouts in the UK taking up the Seal Team program. Here is a link to the Scout website so you can learn more; http://www.scoutbase.org.uk/activity/outdoor/adventure/scubascout.htm Speaking of the PADI Seal Team, they made an appearance in October at the Scuba Extasea Expo in Denver, Colorado, USA. They were signing autographs and having a great time. Shina, Blade, Kiros, Daria and Alano even had their pictures taken with real-life U.S. Navy Seals. It was great. By now, you should have received two special Fellow Diver newsletters inviting you to bring three friends into scuba diving and receive a $50.00 check from PADI. I'm happy to report that the program is a big success! The scuba industry at large is jumping on the bandwagon developing associated offers for those of you who show them your PADI check. We will be doing our best to keep track of the many offers so that we can keep you informed. Please keep checking the PADI website and be on the look out for more special newsletters. I did receive quite a few e-mails about the PADI Diving Society. Currently, there are two PADI Diving Societies. One is based in the US and the other is based in the UK and serves that region. The official publication of the PADI Diving Society in the US is Sport Diver magazine. I encourage you to visit their site at; www.sportdiver.com to learn more about Society membership and the magazine. And, PADI Diving Society members receive another $25.00 from Sport Diver when three friends or family members receive their PADI Open Water Diver certification. Sport Diver also has a great email newsletter you can receive for free. Just drop in and register online at http://www.sportdiver.com/idiver The holidays are quickly sneaking up on us. So what scuba-related gift can you give your friends or family? Here is an idea. We recently added cool post cards to the padi.com website. One is a gift certificate for $10.00 off the PADI Open Water Diver course. Send friends or family members the post card and when they follow the simple directions and complete the Open Water Diver course, they get $10.00 directly from PADI. Just follow this link: www.padi.com/fun/postcard2 And don't forget to wish them happy holidays. It's a nice gift that doesn't cost you a thing. If you happened to be in the Cayman Islands the first week of November, you might have met Michelle. ""She"" was the hurricane that came blowing through literally hours before PADI Diving Society's Total Submersion Event. Despite this, Sunset House, a PADI Gold Palm Resort, and the event's host hotel did an incredible job of making everyone feel at home. If you were at Total Submersion, you would have seen something unusual. Me diving next to a mermaid! That's right, I dove the Mermaid off Sunset House and have pictures to prove it! Take a look at http://www.padi.com/padi/offices/americas/news/mermaid/. Despite the initial bad weather, more than 70 people had a fabulous week. Please consider joining us next year at this fantastic event. Details will be posted on the PADI website as they become available. I know this is getting a little long, so until next time, get a friend (or three) and go diving. And, drop me a line to let me know about your latest dive adventure.

There is NO retroactive suspension.  Carl Wood introduced the ALJ's draft decision, with a diatribe against dire= ct access. He said that DA is a subsidy from less attractive customers to = large customers and an example of the saying that, ""big dogs eat first and = big dogs eat best."" He added that most comments advocated delay of suspens= ion and no retroactivity. He said he ""finds it hard to consider these comm= ents to be anything but misleading and disingenuous."" He added that, ""Smal= l consumers effectively have no options."" He said retroactivity will be th= e subject of further review, although it was not clear what this meant. Wi= thin 14 days, the UDCs must inform the Energy Division of steps taken not t= o accept DASRs for contracts entered into after 9/20/01. He said that dire= ct access is half of the failed deregulation process; the other half was op= ening ourselves up to the erratic wholesale market.

Should we not be looking to get more detail of exactly the reasons were especially for human errors and highlight those areas where the problems arise rather than grouping things together and in so doing losing the detail ? Also we should try to get some trend information so that it is clear where we are improving (or not as the case may be) on both a general and specific book basis.

I am glad to say that the human error rate is very low and over this (approximate) 30 business day period and in fact there were only 5 human errors on around 120 officialised DPRs. London IT are also going to analyse the data to try to pinpoint trends in their area. Please let me know if this is informative. Regards James",2035,"Dear James, Thanks for the e-mail. The info I sent yesterday was not complied by me. I took over the reporting just yesterday and am making changes to it. The information I will provide on the log from London is what I hear in the morning meeting. What I need to do is ensure I get complete info from you, so I will send you the London information each day as I understand it and you can add comments.

Credit Suisse First Boston is leading the transaction, which will be held by a small number of banks, those familiar with the loan said. The generating company is a separate legal entity from Edison and its insolvent utility subsidiary, Southern California Edison. A holding company that owns all of Edison Mission's stock was set up earlier this year to protect the company's assets in case the utility ends up in bankruptcy. ``It would be harder to get any financing done at any of the Edison subsidiaries after a bankruptcy filing'' by Southern California Edison, said Jon Kyle Cartwright, a senior energy credit analyst at Raymond James & Associates, Inc. in St. Petersburg, Florida. Edison Mission borrowed from its three bank lines and has to repay bank debt of $250 million by mid-August. The new loan will replace the $1 billion of bank credit lines that the company has to repay by Oct. 10, the people said. ``Getting this financing done is probably one of the reasons that SoCalEd hasn't filed'' for bankruptcy protection, Cartwright said. Negotiating a Solution Southern California Edison ran up more than $5.4 billion in debts to pay for soaring wholesale power costs last year. The state's power deregulation laws prohibited the company from passing on those costs in the form of higher consumer rates. In an effort to conserve cash, the utility defaulted on more than $930 million of notes and commercial paper in January. The utility also owes energy providers more than $1 billion. Any three unsecured creditors can file a petition to put the utility into involuntary bankruptcy. Ted Craver, chief financial officer at Edison, said that the company believes that bankruptcy isn't an answer to the ``political/regulatory problem'' that put the utility into this position. ``We continue to seek a negotiated solution to restore'' the utility's creditworthiness, Craver said on a conference call with investors holding the defaulted debt. While Southern California Edison is junk-rated, Edison Mission Energy has the lowest investment grade credit ratings -- ``BBB-'' from Standard & Poor's and ``Baa3'' from Moody's Investors Service. Investment Grade Edison Mission sold $600 million of 10-year notes in April, which are trading between 96 and 97 cents on the dollar, up from between 92.5 and 95 cents on the dollar at the end of June. Moody's based the company's investment grade ratings on the fact that it has enough cash flow to cover its debts and that its assets ought to be protected in case Southern California Edison either files for bankruptcy protection or is pushed into it. The new loans are split between 364-day and three-year maturities, bankers familiar with the deal said. ``These are lottery tickets, not investments,'' said Cartwright. Those who buy them are ``investing on optimism, not on arithmetic, and that isn't a good investment strategy.'' The bankruptcy remote structure, which PG&E Corp., the parent of bankrupt Pacific Gas & Electric Co., also put in place to protect its generating subsidiary's assets, hasn't been tested in court yet, analysts said. --Liz Goldenberg in the New York newsroom at (212) 893-3940 or at egoldenberg2@bloomberg.net and Mark Lake at (212) 893-5989 or at mlake1@bloomberg.net with reporting by Terrence Flanagan/jm Story illustration: For Edison's and its subsidiaries' debt, see {EIX <CORP> <GO>} For the Edison Mission Energy 9 7/8 percent coupon notes due in April 2011, see {281023AG6 <CORP> DES <GO>} Company News: EIX US <Equity> PCG US <Equity> News by category: NI ELC NI UTI NI NRG NI MMK NI CP NI FRN NI MTN NI LOANS NI SYNLOANS NI COR -0- (BN ) Jul/26/2001 19:30 GMT",4526,"I don't know what his experience has been, but Mr. Cartwright appears to be a bit pessimistic on EME credit.

[Geaccone, Tracy] Costs have been reduced due to Dynegy transition. If we assume under our control, costs would be the same or slightly lower.

I can reduce the amount to $112,500,000 which is the Citibank prepay amount allocated to NNG if that sounds reasonable. 5) We will show a reduction in A/R of $1.807 billion and a corresponding reduction in equity due to the MCTJ loan.

One of the concerns I have is that the timing is such that it is unlikely, given the legislative session end of September 15th(??), that we are going to get much traction. (Aside from the fact that it seems difficult to convey the nuances of this deal over a conference call). It may not be relevant in this environment, but this idea makes sense. It is an issue of who will listen and who will act. It seems to make sense to propose the structure to DWR. Given the dilemma of how to marry both the Utilities' revenue requirement with that of DWRs on a go forward basis, anything that proposes to lower a portion of either of these revenue demands should be addressed. The proposal to DWR could go as follows: Either Edison and PG&E could separately participate in the dual auction process to buy out the QF agreement and replace with market energy or the contracts could be assigned to DWR and DWR could conduct the dual auction. Assignment of the contracts to DWR would be contingent on a successful auction process. A buyout of the high priced QF agreements would provide for added head room under the rate caps and thus provide a basis for the higher cost DWR contracts. In addition, it appears for our analysis, the savings would be such that you could roll in the outstanding debt owed to the QFs and not exceed the existing payment to the QF under the current capacity plus SRAC pricing. As such it seems that it could be construed as a restructuring of contracts and not a BAIL OUT of SCE. (I say this because my understanding of SB 78 is that a portion of the debt is to pay the back payments owed QFs. Is this portion of the bill being viewed by the radical contingent as a bail out?)

The HMS technician did contact measurement once to get the volumes zeroed out but apparently he will have to get with them again. I have notified the tech and he is in the process of doing this. The meter is set on pressure control and the valve is open. Gas Control's understanding and the field's understanding is that at the time the Brandywine deal ended some sort of standby agreement was in place. If this is not the case please let me know and we will notify the plant and close the valve. Robert, In the future if you have meters like this where there is a small flow volume without a nomination in place please check with Earl and myself so we can investigate before we get commercial involved.

I am still collecting a few agreements (Ganady Batrak's prior service agreement and Bob Campbells agreement) and will also be collecting copies of our agreements with Enron Net Works employees for review. With respect to the NDA's, they have all been drafted and it is my understanding that they were sent to our counterparties last week. Oracle has already signed an NDA and I have a copy if you would like to have it. I would suggest that before we have further conversations with Oracle that we consider asking them to also sign a non-solicitation agreement with us. The NDA with Oracle is the only NDA that does not contain a non-solicitation provision. In order to facilitate getting the rest of NDA's signed as quickly as possible, I would suggest that Rex ask each of his contacts for the name and phone number of the legal counsel reviewing the agreement and I will give them a call and find out if they have any issues that need to be resolved.

I will badger Chris in the morning, but I can't guarantee an answer until later this week after the dust has settled from the 1st. Thanks for understanding. -Angie"

The buyer would like to begin the due diligence process as early as possible and has asked to review info related to the following: 1) Maintenance records for last 3 years 2) right-of-way / easement agreements The potential benefits to TW of this transaction include 1) monetizing an asset that today is generating zero value and 2) creating a new source of gas supply into TW from the buyer. Questions I have are: a) Can we designate a ""point"" person from the Monahans Team that I can coordinate with and who would that be? b) Where / who has the records & documents for the items above? Your timely response is greatly appreciated. Please coordinate with me all questions / concerns.

Our current estimate on cost reductions for EA Operations is less than the $5.4MM estimated 2 weeks ago. Beth Perlman and team are continuing to work tonight and will have details available tomorrow. We are in agreement, as Bob Hall has worked with Beth's team to eliminate 4 main projects on the production support systems (MKM Enhancements, Unify Production Tuning, Decaf Strategic Rewrite, and one other that escapes me at the moment).

GP -----Original Message----- From: Beck, Sally Sent: Monday, November 19, 2001 9:53 PM To: Kitchen, Louise Cc: Piper, Greg Subject: RE: Preliminary Cost Savings for EA Our current plan on EA Operations would be to eliminate any planned headcount addtions and to reduce the current staff levels by 10%. I will get with you on Tuesday morning to review the names, but I feel confident that few if any would be recognized by your commerical guys, as we only engage our best in interfacing with the traders. Our current estimate on cost reductions for EA Operations is less than the $5.4MM estimated 2 weeks ago. Beth Perlman and team are continuing to work tonight and will have details available tomorrow. We are in agreement, as Bob Hall has worked with Beth's team to eliminate 4 main projects on the production support systems (MKM Enhancements, Unify Production Tuning, Decaf Strategic Rewrite, and one other that escapes me at the moment). Beth and her team are also working on the cost savings that will result from potentially halting or slowing down other commercially-driven IT projects. The headcount impact and dollar savings from these project eliminations are what Beth's team is focused on tonight. --Sally -----Original Message----- From: Kitchen, Louise Sent: Monday, November 19, 2001 9:18 PM To: Beck, Sally Cc: Piper, Greg Subject: RE: Preliminary Cost Savings for EA Pretty huge cuts, I agree on cutting costs, its more about redefining and you may want to realign your business (as you said bring in some people from other areas).

Charles Subject: Fort Pierce Repowering Project (""FPRP"") - Undyed Fuel Purchase Charlie: Per our conversation earlier today, I outline below the steps to proceed in addressing the following four taxes: Federal Excise Tax, Pollutant Fee, Florida State Tax and Local Option Fee. It is my understanding that Central Oil has paid all four taxes and is currently billing Florida Municipal Power Agency (""FMPA"") for the same. Enron has agreed to reimburse FMPA for all such moneys FMPA pays to Central Oil for the Pollutant Fee. FMPA will be made whole for the moneys paid to Central Oil related to the Federal Excise Tax, Florida State Tax and the Local Option Fee in the form of a refund from either the IRS or the state of Florida. Federal Excise Tax A technical reading related to claims and refunds of Federal Excise Tax on diesel fuel provides that if undyed fuel is sold, tax must be charged. Only the end user can apply for a credit or refund. Per a Fort Pierce Utilities Authority (""FPUA"") letter I received today which was included in a fax from Karlan White at Central Oil, FMPA would be the party who ultimately will pay the fuel bill for the oil (to expedite payment). The billing address, however, will be FPUA; such address would show on the invoices. Ultimately FPUA is the end user of the oil. Nevertheless, I suggest FMPA actually complete the attached Form 8849 and remit such form to the address noted in the instructions. FMPA is the party doing the financial transacting with Central Oil (on behalf of FPUA). At the same time, FMPA should pay the related Federal Excise Taxes to Central Oil since Central Oil has already remitted such moneys to the IRS. The rationale for FPMA filing Form 8849 and not FPUA is that FMPA is the party making the payment to Central Oil. Nevertheless, there is a slight chance the IRS will require FPUA to file the Form 8849 itself. For administrative purposes, though, I suggest FMPA be the party to file. If the IRS does not accept the filing, we can then resubmit Form 8849 using FPUA as the filing entity. Pollutant Fee FMPA agrees to reimburse the Pollutant Fee to Central Oil. Florida State Tax and Local Option Fee FMPA must reimburse Central Oil for both the Florida State Tax and the Local Option Fee. At the same time, FMPA should complete and file the attached Form DR-26, Application for Refund, with the Florida Department of Revenue. << File: DR-26.pdf >> << File: Form 8849 - Sched 1.pdf >> << File: Form 8849.pdf >> If you have any additional questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me.

The deal was structured whereby TW would receive a marketing fee equal to 50% of the rate negotiated in excess of the original contracted rate between ENA and TW; the other 50% goes to ENA. Here's the basics: ENA's contract with TW is at a daily rate of $0.0600 (one-part) The release to Burlington is at a daily rate of $0.0650 (demand only plus applicable commodity and fuel based on usage) TW will bill Burlington through normal course of business (reservation of $34,125 [$0.0650 x 25,000 x 21days] plus applicable commodity fees) ENA demand invoice will need to be adjusted so that they only receive a capacity release credit of $32,812.50 [($0.0650 - $0.0025) x 25,000 x 21days] TW will need to book marketing fee revenues of $1,312.50 [$0.0025 x 25,000 x 21 days] (Richard - do we need/have a separate account for these revenues??) Michelle - I know you indicated that ENA is looking to get a payment of $1,312.50 for their portion of the incremental fee charged. However, we will need to discuss further. The invoice that will be generated to ENA will not represent a credit due them since we would still be billing them for the first 11 days prior to this release. We can discuss further when the billing cycle approaches. If you have any questions, please let me know.
