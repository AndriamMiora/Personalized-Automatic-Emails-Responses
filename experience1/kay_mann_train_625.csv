The troubling news is the ""death spiral"" quote again and the statement that we only have about $2 billion in cash which raises the downgrade issue and also perhaps means that we don't want to announce lay-offs since we can't afford to make any payouts. Enron's Stock, Bonds Drop on Concern for Dynegy Bid (Update3) By Jennifer Ryan New York, Nov. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s bond and stock prices declined amid concern Dynegy Inc.'s proposed $23 billion acquisition of the biggest energy trader may fall through. ``It's a death spiral,'' said Edward Jones & Co. analyst Brian Youngberg, who rates Enron ``sell'' and doesn't own the company's shares. ``With the declining share price and debt disclosures, the chance of the deal going through has fallen from about 90 percent to less than 50 percent.'' Shares of Enron, the third most-active U.S. stock, tumbled as much as 15 percent, dropping for the fourth day in a row. Investors lowered their asking price for the 6.4 percent notes that mature in 2006 to 58 cents on the dollar from 60 cents Friday. Bids to buy bonds were unchanged at 55 cents on the dollar, traders said. The bonds yield 22.55 percent. Concern that Dynegy may change or cancel its bid for Enron had pushed Enron's stock down 48 percent in the past three days. Enron's shares had plummeted 86 percent since mid-October after the company reported a $618 million third-quarter loss and said expansion into water, telecommunications and retail-energy sales cost it $1.01 billion. Part of the third-quarter charge was connected with limited partnerships run by the chief financial officer. He was ousted, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission started an investigation into Enron's accounting. The company earlier this month restated its earnings for the past four years. Talks on $1 Billion Enron said late last week talks are continuing with potential investors for as much as $1 billion. The company agreed to be bought by Dynegy on Nov. 9 for stock and assumed debt, halting a financial crisis that threatened to bankrupt Enron and throw U.S. power and natural-gas markets into turmoil. Shares of Enron fell 54 cents, or 11 percent, to $4.17 in late-morning trading. Earlier, they touched $4.02. Dynegy fell $1.03 to $39.37. The stock had fallen 28 percent this year. Both companies are based in Houston. Egan-Jones Ratings Co. lowered its rating on Enron's credit today to ``BB-'' from ``BB.'' ``Dynegy needs to show its support, or Enron will slide,'' the firm said in a report. ``Time is not Enron's friend,'' said Stewart Morel, co-head of investment grade debt research at UBS Warburg LLC. ``There is increased concern in the market that there may be more problems that are yet to be disclosed.'' On Wednesday, Enron got a three-week reprieve from lenders on a $690 million note due this week, giving the company more time to restructure its finances. Dynegy Chief Executive Officer Chuck Watson said he was ``encouraged'' by the commitment to extend the note payment, as well as the closing of a $450 million credit facility, and that Dynegy remained committed to the merger. $690 Million Note Terms of the $690 million note were outlined for the first time in an Enron filing with the SEC a week ago. Enron also said that it has less than $2 billion in cash and credit lines left. If the company's cash reserves run too low, Enron's credit rating may be cut below investment grade. That would trigger $3.9 billion in debt repayments for two affiliated partnerships. Enron's bankers met with leveraged buyout firms and two industrial companies to seek an investment, the New York Times reported last week. J.P.

They cover the costs of grid interconnection for any site we might develop in ConEd's territory. Apparently, Gary Keevil of East Coast Power has been handling discussions with ConEd to this point, but with East Coast Power out of the picture, I'm picking it up. Kathleen has coached me on questions about these documents. First, do we have a Confidentiality Agreement with ConEd that covers these power development project discussions? She's going to ask Stephen Plauche of Origination about this, but I'm betting we don't have one. Second, are these agreements ""Turbo Park"" compliant, and have we set up an LLC to deal with New York development projects yet? I understand Herman Manus is the expert on this topic. Finally, what are the legal sticking points in these documents? ConEd has called an informational meeting for next Tuesday, May 1st, for these documents. I'm planning to attend.

They cover the costs of grid interconnection for any site we might develop in ConEd's territory. Apparently, Gary Keevil of East Coast Power has been handling discussions with ConEd to this point, but with East Coast Power out of the picture, I'm picking it up. Kathleen has coached me on questions about these documents. First, do we have a Confidentiality Agreement with ConEd that covers these power development project discussions? She's going to ask Stephen Plauche of Origination about this, but I'm betting we don't have one. Second, are these agreements ""Turbo Park"" compliant, and have we set up an LLC to deal with New York development projects yet? I understand Herman Manus is the expert on this topic. Finally, what are the legal sticking points in these documents? ConEd has called an informational meeting for next Tuesday, May 1st, for these documents. I'm planning to attend.

The following is a summary of the LM6000 Title Transfer Question: Mike Storm, GE/SSEP Project Manager, requested from me, on 9/19/00, to accept title of 14 LM6000's no later 9/26/00. I informed him I was not authorized to make this decision and that I would contact the Owner to make the decision. I further informed Mike Storm that our Owner would not accept those terms and a compromise must be worked out. Contract Reference 15.2.1 of contract 24-LM6K-2-99 states: title transfers when equipment is ready to ship to the delivery point and seller notifies purchaser of such event. Delivery Point is defined as the SSEP storage yard. SSEP has notified us that Units #1-14 are ""Ready to Ship"". Contract Reference 10.2.3 of contract 24-LM6K-2-99 states: purchaser has the right to inspect the equipment for ""completeness prior to loading on transport to delivery point"". We have inspected the first eleven Units and have informed SSEP that Units #1-14 ARE NOT COMPLETE and therefore are NOT at the Delivery Point. FACT: Units # 1-11 are at the delivery point. #12-14 are at SSEP. FACT: If we sent a truck to SSEP tomorrow, NONE of the UNITS would be ""Ready to Ship"" to a project site. FACT: SSEP QA/QC has 15 Non Conformance Reports on these 14 turbines which need to be corrected before they are ""Ready to Ship"". It is in the best interests for both companies to correct the Non Conformance's prior to shipment to the delivery point or project site. RECOMMENDATION: I recommend that we DO NOT accept Title until the Units are actually ready to be shipped to a project site. The problem is that NONE OF THE UNITS ARE READY TO SHIP! SSEP has to work off punchlist items which their QA/QC department has listed on Non Conformance Reports. At this juncture, no money can be withheld from SSEP. To ensure they will be fixed, Title should transfer after our QA/QC inspectors give written notice that each Unit is complete and ready to ship. This will protect ENA on the quality of the machines, as well as, ensure that little or no ""re-work"" is performed in the field.

Contract Reference 15.2.1 of contract 24-LM6K-2-99 states: title transfers when equipment is ready to ship to the delivery point and seller notifies purchaser of such event. Delivery Point is defined as the SSEP storage yard. SSEP has notified us that Units #1-14 are ""Ready to Ship"". Contract Reference 10.2.3 of contract 24-LM6K-2-99 states: purchaser has the right to inspect the equipment for ""completeness prior to loading on transport to delivery point"". We have inspected the first eleven Units and have informed SSEP that Units #1-14 ARE NOT COMPLETE and therefore are NOT at the Delivery Point. FACT: Units # 1-11 are at the delivery point. #12-14 are at SSEP. FACT: If we sent a truck to SSEP tomorrow, NONE of the UNITS would be ""Ready to Ship"" to a project site. FACT: SSEP QA/QC has 15 Non Conformance Reports on these 14 turbines which need to be corrected before they are ""Ready to Ship"". It is in the best interests for both companies to correct the Non Conformance's prior to shipment to the delivery point or project site. RECOMMENDATION: I recommend that we DO NOT accept Title until the Units are actually ready to be shipped to a project site. The problem is that NONE OF THE UNITS ARE READY TO SHIP! SSEP has to work off punchlist items which their QA/QC department has listed on Non Conformance Reports. At this juncture, no money can be withheld from SSEP. To ensure they will be fixed, Title should transfer after our QA/QC inspectors give written notice that each Unit is complete and ready to ship. This will protect ENA on the quality of the machines, as well as, ensure that little or no ""re-work"" is performed in the field. If you require further information or any assistance in this matter, please feel free to contact me at 713-646-8258. Matthew Tezyk Project Manager"

Credit support. On the issue of credit support for a project company partially owned by Enron, ABB has some concerns even when Enron still holds an equity interest due to some late payment problems they had in the past with an Enron project company. Also, the ABB and GE payment schedules are different, with GE being more front end loaded. For example, GE will have received 45% of the total payments due by the time the first 4 units are ready to ship; by the time the last 6 units are ready to ship, they will have received 95% of the payment. In contrast, we hold 25% of the price of each ABB unit until delivery (15%) and acceptance (10%) of that particular unit. Effective date. The typical reason for an earlier effective date is to capture any work which ABB may have chosen to do during the option period in order to hold their guaranteed completion dates. In the GE contract we addressed the issue in section 30.3, stating that it governs all work performed pursuant to the agreement in principle. It is fine with me to make the effective date a current one. Price change. I will confirm why the prices changed $78,000 from the latest option agreement.

Please advise. As the Consolidation Agreement was thought by GE to be finalized, and all of the contract documents to be executed last Friday (which did not happen), I am not surprised at the following responses Jeff Smith gave me today to the suggested changes. The edit on page 4 to the last ""Whereas"" is acceptable; The edits to Clauses 2(a) and 2(b) are not accepted. GE does not have any defenses under either contract for insolvency, bankruptcy or similar circumstances because they are events of breach of contract and subject to the remedy of termination if not cured after notice. Pursuant to Clause 5, if one contract is subject to termination, then the other is also. However, we have the ability to partially terminate if we see fit. (Example: Under the Onshore Contract, GEOIC's TD of I personnel do not show up, we can terminate only the TD of I scope and self perform. The equipment, its warranties and guarantees are still in place). GE sees the added language as unnecessary. The suggested lined out changes to Clause 6 is not acceptable to GE. GE requires that the tie back to the notices provisions of the Contracts remain. The other edits to this Clause are acceptable. The suggested change to Clause 15 is not acceptable. GE states that they wish to remain simplistic and firm in this document, and that it should not reflect Enron's buisness arrangements such as the subsequent assignment to Mitsui. GE wants to be sure the assignment language is not skirted. If the ENA parent guarantee has not been provided by the time the Contracts are assigned to Mitsui, the Assignment provisions of the Contracts allow for the replacement of the ENA obligation by other equivalent guarantees or assurances. Additionally, the ENA parent guarantee (a guarantee substantially less than one provided by Enron Crop) was originally to be provided as a condition precedent to execution of the Contracts, but we talked them into a due date of 30 days later. This request looks like retrading the deal to GE and they do not want to lose the little comfort they have now.

The revised version is in Word format and my suggested changes are highlighted as you requested in your 10/19/01 email transmitting the proposed agreement. My first change is at the end of paragraph 2. It addresses my concern that any documents you give us that you consider confidential information will be so marked on every page, while taking our conversation into account and allowing other nonwritten confidential information provided to be covered as well. The next two changes are the typo we discussed in paragraph 3 and an additional sentence at the end of that paragraph. The sentence is added simply to recognize the need for timely provision of a Public Disclosure Copy in a regulatory or court proceeding. Finally, I have added the phrase found at the end of the first sentence of paragraph 7 to the end of the third sentence of that paragraph. I believe this addition is consistent with Enron's intent, but makes it more explicit.

Tax Assessment Letter - Livingston County personell (Pontiac site) have requested that Titan LLC enter into a tax assessment agreement related to the Project. Mark Gershon (Piper Rudnick) is preparing a draft letter for the County using the Assessment Agreement form utilized in our Kendall County Special Use Permit as a template and based upon discussions between myself, Rusty, Mark, and Warren Schick/Robert Tillota of ENA's tax department. Mark will forward a draft of this letter to us for review/comment before we submit it to Livingston County. Please co-ordinate with Mark directly in order to minimize the outside legal costs of this Agreement. 2. ComEd Interconnection Agreement - ComEd recently (1/30/01) sent me their boilerplate draft Interconnection Agreement (IA) for the Kendall LLC and Titan LLC projects. Under ComEd's tariff we have 90 days to execute the IA in order to maintain our position(s) in ComEd's interconnection queue. I have told ComEd that we would likely modify their boilerplate IA to make it resemble the IA signed by ENA and ComEd in Q2 2000 on the Des Plaines LLC project in Will County, Illinois. My preference would be to wait a few weeks on starting negotiations on either IA so that we can attempt to finalize a sale of member interests with either PSEG or Entergy.

I just discovered it yesterday (while at the office). We went to Arlington for my nephew's high school graduation, which was fine. Sunday we had dinner with Dan Lyons and spouse, which was wonderful. Yesterday I cooked, shopped, and puttered in the yard. Got the last caladium bulbs in the ground. I like to wait until they are on sale. The weekend just flew by. ""They"" say sleeping on backs reducing risks of sudden infant death syndrome. Go figure. At least you can see their beautiful faces while they sleep. Car seats, strollers and diapers are 100x better now. Especially the diapers. Yesterday I had a feeling that your grandbaby is a boy. Just came to me in the kitchen. I have a 50/50 chance of being right! When I was in Austin I used an ""above the water"" pedal kayak. Talk about easy. Neil is talking about us renting to see what we like best. The above the water is more stable than I expected. I had assumed that it would be tippy, but it really wasn't. Hope you have high water and not hell next weekend. ckm From: Kathleen Carnahan/ENRON@enronXgate on 05/29/2001 09:12 AM To: Kay Mann/Corp/Enron@Enron cc: Subject: RE: FW: Revised form of Memorandum of Option 25 years ago for me (Shayne is 25 today).

Apparently is was not a real big deal, but I think it was her first ordeal of the kind. Re: sleeping on backs, I still don't understand that one. I always thought they were to sleep on their stomachs to avoid choaking if they threw up. Did you do anything fun this weekend? We just puttered around the house and I worked on PRC's yesterday.

I told y'all that I was going to leave ASAP for Waco. I am out Thursday night at 9:00 PM. I would be happy to move all my stuff home on Friday, but neither one of you can come up that early. Last time we moved out, Neil had everything pretty much out of the car by the time you and I got home. So, I didn't think it would be that different, except I wouldn't be there to organize my stuff. I guess I can come home Friday with as much stuff as I can fit in my car and then back up Saturday with y'all to put the big stuff in one of our big cars. I thought you knew exactly what I was planning. Basically, Tim and Abbey are waiting on me to be done to leave, so I am trying to get moved out quickly. Mikey gets out Wednesday night as well, I think, so he has to move all of his stuff back on Thursday. I wasn't going to ask him to go from College Station to Houston to here to Houston to Waco for me. Plus his car is pretty small anyway. He will be more than willing to help put big stuff in the car on Saturday, I'm sure. Anyway, so do you want me to come home with all I can on Friday, and then all of us come up on Saturday? I can just pack all my crap that will fit in the car on Thursday night after I finish finals. That would mean y'all moving my big stuff without me when you get back to Houston on Saturday. But I don't usually help with that stuff anyway (i.e. my couch, trunk, patio furniture) Paige At 02:38 PM 05/01/2001 -0500, you wrote: > >No, I was wrong.

I told y'all that I was going to leave ASAP for Waco. I am out Thursday night at 9:00 PM. I would be happy to move all my stuff home on Friday, but neither one of you can come up that early. Last time we moved out, Neil had everything pretty much out of the car by the time you and I got home. So, I didn't think it would be that different, except I wouldn't be there to organize my stuff. I guess I can come home Friday with as much stuff as I can fit in my car and then back up Saturday with y'all to put the big stuff in one of our big cars. I thought you knew exactly what I was planning. Basically, Tim and Abbey are waiting on me to be done to leave, so I am trying to get moved out quickly. Mikey gets out Wednesday night as well, I think, so he has to move all of his stuff back on Thursday. I wasn't going to ask him to go from College Station to Houston to here to Houston to Waco for me. Plus his car is pretty small anyway. He will be more than willing to help put big stuff in the car on Saturday, I'm sure. Anyway, so do you want me to come home with all I can on Friday, and then all of us come up on Saturday? I can just pack all my crap that will fit in the car on Thursday night after I finish finals. That would mean y'all moving my big stuff without me when you get back to Houston on Saturday. But I don't usually help with that stuff anyway (i.e. my couch, trunk, patio furniture) Paige At 02:38 PM 05/01/2001 -0500, you wrote: > >No, I was wrong.

The deal that we are on the path of closing is consistent with the executed DASH and works as follows: at the signing of the letter agreement, NW pays ENA $3 million, with another $5 million paid on July 15 (the Turbine Deposits). The balance of $40 million is paid by NW at such time as the assignment of the turbine contract is made to the LLC, and ENA sells the LLC member interests to NW. The outside date for this to occur, via a notice provided by NW, is Sept. 1. The $8 million paid by NW, and the obligation to purchase the member interests is a firm commitment guaranteed by Northwestern Corp. The only condition to NW's obligation to purchase the member interests is that ENA effect the assignment of the turbine contract into the LLC. If ENA does not effect the assignment, then NW would also be entitled to a return of the $8 million in Turbine Deposits. This structure is the same we followed for the Intergen deal which closed in January, except the Intergen deal did not have an extended period between the date of execution of the letter agreement, and the turbine contract assignment. In the Intergen deal, ENA did not receive any payments prior to the assignment and sale of the member interests. The earnings issue raised by accounting (Herman Manis) is that, notwithstanding NW's firm commitment to purchase, ENA has two (albeit very minor) performance obligations. First, ENA has to obtain an Acknowledgement and Consent from GE prior to or concurrent with exercising its purchase option with E Next and assigning the turbine contract to the LLC (we have had to do this for every turbine transaction). Second, ENA has to perform under its agreement with E Next in that if there is an event of default prior to the time we effect the assignment, we theoretically could loose our purchase option right with E Next and be unable to perform under our agreement with NW. We have suggested to Herman that both of these items are perfunctory in nature, and that all income from this transaction should be recognized upon execution of the letter agreement, We have further stated that we could obtain a letter from GE solving the first issue, but there is no solution to the second issue. Herman advised us that to the extent we receive a letter from GE on the first issue, and can convince Arthur Anderson that the second item is perfunctory in nature, we could recognize all income upon execution of the letter agreement (prior to the actual assignment of the turbine contract to the LLC). He did not think we had a good case relative to the second issue, and is reluctant to approach Arthur Anderson. Thus, based on the above, in a worst case we may not be able to recognize any income form this transaction until Q3. While we think we have a shot at getting accounting to change their position, we do not think that this outcome should change our position on the deal as the underlying profitability is significant. The deal is also consistent with the approved DASH. We therefore recommend that we proceed with the execution of the letter agreement, and then decide as to how we should proceed on the income recognition issue depending on your views regarding income being recognized in Q2 vs. Q3. Please advise me if you are OK with us closing on the deal as scheduled, or if you have any other questions. Regards, Ben",4604,Questions re Northwestern from one of the Enron execs.

However, near the end of the paragraph, the word ""remedy"" should move to immediately after ""exclusive"". * In 8, the reference should be to paragraph 10.a, not 11.a. * In 10.a, it does not look like the wording in my 30/May/00 e-mail was picked up. * In 12 and 13, Enron has added new wording since the preceding issuance of this document. * In 13, is all of this wording necessary and applicable. At the end of the first long sentence, the word ""turnkey"" is used. Of course, this is an equipment supply contract for GE. Also, I believe the contracts do state what is in GE scope via clauses 1.27, 1.86 and 3.1. So, the last sentence is redundant. * More importantly, these two clauses could be interpreted as establishing a GEPS/GEIOC consortium. This is something GE had advocated as the approach in a single contract, for tax purposes, in Mexico. GE can still go either way, although the single document approach is more straightforward (and that is what we initialed, as a complete document, in your offices last month). Enron wanted split contracts. These clauses may undo what Enron was attempting to achieve in this regard. * In 14, which has been added by Enron in the latest version of the consolidation agreement, the GE entities seem to be prevented from getting an extension of time under one contract if there is a problem with performance under the other. This is contrary to the words in the former Enron clause 5, which has now been eliminated. This clause 14 should be removed. * Regarding the ""swap"" payments for tax purposes, to benefit both Enron and GE: * The amount paid to date on the Monterrey unit, under the MOU, is $25,101,733. What GE proposes it to: * Revise the payment schedule for the contracts such that payments totaling this amount are due 2-3 days after contract signing. * Execute a separate letter, to be signed at the same time as the contracts, formally dissolving the MOU. The letter would call for GE to refund this same amount 2-3 days after receipt of the payment under the contracts. We need to draft this letter, which will hopefully be one page. The text of such a letter could include the following wording: ""Pursuant to clause 30.3 of the now executed On and Off Shore contracts for this project, the MOU dated ______ is made null and void. Once the initial payment(s) called for in said contracts have been made, the monies in the amount of $25,101,733.00, which were paid under the MOU will be refunded to (Enron entity)."" * This would get the monies to the appropriate Enron and GE entities.

Springer"" <bjspringer@JonesDay.com> on 05/07/2001 12:10:15 PM To: Gregg.Penman@enron.com cc: kay.mann@enron.com Subject: Re: Master Sales Gregg: In late 1999, the ICC Staff conducted an informal ""workshop"" regarding a proposed set of affiliate transaction rules for gas utilities. Enron Energy Services, peoples and others filed comments. Based on the comments, Staff circulated a proposed rule but there was no immediate follow-up. The Commission issued a notice indicating that it would further review the matter after its January, 2000 gas policy meeting. Thereafter, in August, 2000, the ICC Staff submiited a Report recommending that a rule be adopted. On Sept. 22, 2000, the rule was published for ""first notice"" in the Illinois Register. The ICC also initiated Docket 00-0586 to review the rules. In Docket 00-0586, the assigned Hearing Examiner determined that no hearings would be held to review the rules. As a result, only written comments were considered. Several parties (including Peoples/North Shore) filed comments (although Enron did not). The Examiner issued a Proposed Order on April 23, which-if adopted-would direct publication of the rules for ""second notice"" (45 days for the Joint Comm. on Admin. Rules to comment before final effectiveness). The issues raised by the comment s are summarized in the Proposed Order. Exceptions to the Proposed Order (i.e., comments regarding the proposed decision) are due May 11 and replies to Excpetions are due May 18. The Examiner did not attach the modified rule, but notes that the few changes made to Staff's initial draft are discussed in the order. I will fax to you the Proposed Order and Staff initial draft rule.

Springer"" <bjspringer@JonesDay.com> on 05/07/2001 12:10:15 PM To: Gregg.Penman@enron.com cc: kay.mann@enron.com Subject: Re: Master Sales Gregg: In late 1999, the ICC Staff conducted an informal ""workshop"" regarding a proposed set of affiliate transaction rules for gas utilities. Enron Energy Services, peoples and others filed comments. Based on the comments, Staff circulated a proposed rule but there was no immediate follow-up. The Commission issued a notice indicating that it would further review the matter after its January, 2000 gas policy meeting. Thereafter, in August, 2000, the ICC Staff submiited a Report recommending that a rule be adopted. On Sept. 22, 2000, the rule was published for ""first notice"" in the Illinois Register. The ICC also initiated Docket 00-0586 to review the rules. In Docket 00-0586, the assigned Hearing Examiner determined that no hearings would be held to review the rules. As a result, only written comments were considered. Several parties (including Peoples/North Shore) filed comments (although Enron did not). The Examiner issued a Proposed Order on April 23, which-if adopted-would direct publication of the rules for ""second notice"" (45 days for the Joint Comm. on Admin. Rules to comment before final effectiveness). The issues raised by the comment s are summarized in the Proposed Order. Exceptions to the Proposed Order (i.e., comments regarding the proposed decision) are due May 11 and replies to Excpetions are due May 18. The Examiner did not attach the modified rule, but notes that the few changes made to Staff's initial draft are discussed in the order. I will fax to you the Proposed Order and Staff initial draft rule. The next step in the process is ICC review of the Proposed Order, followed presumably by Illinois Register Publicaion of the adopted rule. ========== The preceding e-mail message (including any attachments) contains information that may be confidential, be protected by the attorney-client or other applicable privileges, or constitute non-public information.

I've also spoken to Herman about his concern that I didn't put in an additional Whereas statement that specifically stated that this agreement is not a binding obligation on PBEC's part to build the facility or incur any of the fees addressed. Ben and I also discussed this and I had hoped that adding a Whereas Clause that says ""PBEC desires to construct the Facility if it receives all requisite local, city, county, state or federal approvals for development and construction thereof"" made it clearly contingent and that, coupled with broad assignment and termination language, would suffice. As Barbara specifically pointed out at our meeting, the agreement is in fact a binding agreement but the obligations under the agreement are not binding until the conditions subsequent have occurred (being the commencement of construction) and the events of commencement of construction are entirely within PBEC's control. I guess I'm not clear as to what the concern is for adding the word ""designee"" when the agreement says PBEC has the sole and absolute right to assign to another party, without the City's consent and, if we elect to not build the facility or the agreement otherwise terminates, PBEC is relieved of all obligations under the agreement, which is what is provided for in Section 16.d.

From: Roseann Engeldorf/ENRON@enronXgate on 04/18/2001 05:42 PM To: Ann Elizabeth White/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Herman Manis/ENRON@enronXgate, Lisa Bills/ENRON@enronXgate Subject: MOA - Pompano Beach Ann Elizabeth - I have reviewed the latest draft - is there any reason why we can't add the phrase ""or its designee"" in the definition of ""PBEC""? Although I understand you have included a broad assignment provision, it helps to include ""designee"" language to show our compliance with the facility structure. Thanks, Rose"

It proposes that ENA agree to share all future development costs and environmental liabilities on the Torrence parcel on a 50/50 basis. I believe that there are some inconsistencies between the language in this Agreement and the PDA signed in April of 2000 (i.e. dates, terms, and the members of the management committee). I have informed PERC that it is ENA's policy not to step in the chain of title on properties with known environmental liabilities. I have recommended to PERC that PGL (Peoples regulated utility) buy the Torrence property (they want if for remediation purposes anyway) from Air Liquide on June 26th and hold it while PERC and ENA complete the due diligence required to develop a commercially viable power plant development project. It will be my recommendation that ENA does not execute this cost sharing agreement as written. If the environmental liability risk was removed and stronger language inserted on the control of going-forward development expenditures then it would represent a commercially reasonable agreement. Ideally we would like this agreement to provide for ENA to market the Torrence and other development sites (ENA's sell-down strategy) under a known value sharing formula and transaction financial ""triggers"". I will discuss this approach with Laura Luce and Curtis Cole this week. From a legal perspective, could we structure a long-term lease between PGL and Torrence Power LLC (PERC & ENA as owners) that could provide commercial site control to PERC/ENA while leaving the environmental liabilities on the Torrence property with PGL? (this would be fitting, because PGL has owned the property in the past and have likely been the major contributor to the site's environmental contamination). Call me to discuss these issues.

Subject: Termination / Release letters for Producers on Dominion Transmission Kay - Thanks for your attention and assistance in this matter. Several gas producers are flowing gas through Dominion Transmission pipeline to Enron's pool. They have terminated their contracts with Enron, or have sent documents to us to terminate their contracts with Enron. They are calling now requesting letters confirming termination of their contracts and/or letters releasing their gas on Dominion Transmission's pipe from Enron's pool in order to satisfy Dominion Transmission's requirement for proof of termination and/or release of gas back to the producers. Dominion Transmission is holding these producers' gas and is not letting the producers sell their gas to other buyers. I have been trying for the last three weeks to discover the route these requests need to pass through in order to get the aforementioned termination and release notices. I have met with little success and fewer answers. Prior to my being involved, Nelson Ferries had forwarded a few requests through Contracts and Legal and had Fred Lagrasta sign off on them. I also talked to several people last week in Contracts and Legal asking for help, but a process does not seem to be in place. Please advise as to how quickly we can act on these requests. Producers are fearful of not being able to sell their January 2002 gas (ie. not getting paid) and are facing severe financial hardships. Please advise as to what I can provide or help out with this process. A list of producers is provided below. I am sure more producers will call.

I have not spoken with any legal counsel representing ENA. Summary: Sonat has netted our Parked Gas Balance with our Loaned Gas Balance and filed a motion with the courts to retain the remaining Parked Gas Balance, 92,949 dth per my conversation with Sonat, to offset $879,030.42 ENA owes Sonat for the purchase of gas in October 2001. According to Sonat, the payment was due November 26, 2001 but ENA did not pay. Sonat's motion is set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th. ENA recognizes a balance of 197,537 dth - the difference is ENA is not netting the 96,000 dth Loan with the park and Sonat is showing an additional day of withdrawal of 8,588 dth in January 2002. Chris's notes: Sonat Park & Loans 2/19/02 History - Per Dave Dyer (205-326-2007) at Sonat ENA has 2 Park & Loan (PAL) contracts with Sonat. All PAL's with Sonat are under master contract PAL1001. Sonat assigns a deal number to each deal under this contract. Deal #1424 - ENA borrowed a total of 96,000 dth from Nov 3rd-5th and has not paid this back. ENA still owes Sonat 96,000 dth. The terms of the deal were to payback Sonat anytime with 3 days notice on any 3 days on 2002, SONAT ONLY CHARGED ENA $96.00 FOR THIS DEAL, because Sonat needed to get gas off the system. Deal #1222 - ENA parked 309,192 dth in August to come out in Jan 2002. Sonat let ENA withdraw 42,951 on 11/29/01 leaving a balance of 266,241 dth. In Jan 2002, ENA withdrew 8,588 dth per day for the 1st-9th. That left a balance of 188,949 dth. On Jan 8th, 2002, Sonat sent a letter stating that Sonat will hold on to the remaining to balance to offset 1) the Loaned gas on deal #1424 (96,000 dth) and 2) to offset dollars ENA has not paid Sonat for gas Sonat sold to ENA in October 2001. According to Sonat, the remaining balance on this deal is 92,949 dth = [309,192 parked in Aug - 42,951 w/d in Nov - 77,292 w/d in Jan - 92,000 balance on #1424]. According to Sonat's letter, Sonat has filed the appropriate motion for court approval for the offsets. According to Dave, ENA is being billed $.00305 x daily balance in this account. ENA should have paid some bigger amount went the gas was parked in August. Other items; ENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October 2001. ENA purchased 286,998 at an average price of $3.063 = $879,030.42. According to Sonat, ENA did not pay for this before Enron declared bankruptcy. ENA also sold Sonat gas - 16,000 dth day at $2.885 (sitara #1172076) in January 2002 and 10,000 dth day at $2.955 in May 2002 (sitara #1172087). ENA used 77,292 dth (8,588 dth per day for Jan 1st - 9th) of the parked gas on deal #1222 to supply the 16,000 dth before Sonat stopped ENA from withdrawing from the park. ENA defaulted on 418,708 dth of the Sonat deal in January. Sonat's in house legal counsel is Patti Frances (205-325-7696). I left a message for Patti to call me. 2/20/02 Patti Frances returned my call. Patti said the motion is currently set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th. I asked Patti if there were any penalties for not performing on the Jan 2002 sale to Sonat and if Sonat was going to pay for the 77,292 dth that ENA did supply. Patti said she didn't think there were penalties but she would verify that and see if they were going to pay. I also asked her if Sonat is still honoring the ENA sale to Sonat in May 2002 and if Sonat would pay ENA if ENA performed. She will check on it and call me back.",3988,Mark Ellenberg is working on the response.

In November, Gregg Penman had sent me two confidentiality agreements related to enovate and asked that I forward any comments to you directly. I finally have reviewed them and have a couple comments. The only proposed changes that need explanation are in paragraphs 1 and 3 of each agreement. Paragraphs 1 and 3 are typical provisions in a confidentiality agreement where each side is evaluating a transaction. However, the confidential information disclosed under these particular agreements is going to be used not only for trading activities but also in connection with audit rights related to an existing and ongoing contractual relationship. The confidentiality agreements should not affect enovate's and PMW's rights under the LLC Agreement. Accordingly, the proposed changes are my attempt to clarify the usual text. Please call if you wish to discuss. I believe my procrastination has resulted in the business people wanting to sign these up next week, so your attention to this is appreciated.

In November, Gregg Penman had sent me two confidentiality agreements related to enovate and asked that I forward any comments to you directly. I finally have reviewed them and have a couple comments. The only proposed changes that need explanation are in paragraphs 1 and 3 of each agreement. Paragraphs 1 and 3 are typical provisions in a confidentiality agreement where each side is evaluating a transaction. However, the confidential information disclosed under these particular agreements is going to be used not only for trading activities but also in connection with audit rights related to an existing and ongoing contractual relationship. The confidentiality agreements should not affect enovate's and PMW's rights under the LLC Agreement. Accordingly, the proposed changes are my attempt to clarify the usual text. Please call if you wish to discuss. I believe my procrastination has resulted in the business people wanting to sign these up next week, so your attention to this is appreciated. Thanks. <<Conf Ag enovate L.L.C. (evaluation of enovate LLC) v1 ENOVATE CMTS MRK.doc>> <<Conf Ag Peoples Energy Resources Corp.

Reuters Boeing Sets 2,900 New Job Cuts Monday November 26, 1:36 PM EST SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing Co (BA). on Monday announced2,900 job cuts, boosting its total since the Sept. 11 hijackattacks to 14,900 or nearly half the 30,000 jobs it has said itcould cut by the end of 2002. The 2,900 employees getting 60-day layoff notices on Mondayincluded 2,100 in Boeing's beleaguered commercial jet unit,where orders have shriveled as airlines park aircraft and cutdeliveries of new jets to match shrinking air travel demand,spokesman Tom Ryan told Reuters. Chicago-based Boeing said the latest cuts also include 700workers in its shared services group and another 100 mostlyfrom its embryonic Connexion airborne Internet service and itsJoint Strike Fighter program, which lost a massive Pentagonaward to rival Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT). last month. The latest 2,900 cuts include 1,900 jobs in the Seattlearea, Ryan said. Boeing in October announced 12,000 job cuts, which takeeffect on Dec. 14, and said it would ultimately cut a total of20,000 to 30,000 workers. The first round included 11,400commercial airplane workers and 600 from shared services. Boeing also redeployed 200 of 600 Connexion workers in lateSeptember as airlines backed away from the service and Boeingfocused on flight safety and security applications for thesatellite-based communications network. The aerospace giant has slashed projected deliveries fromits world-leading commercial jet unit to 350 to 400 in 2002from an expected 522 this year. In 2003 the forecast falls evenlower and some industry analysts believe the totals will falleven lower. Earlier this month Boeing Chairman Phil Condit predictedthe current travel slump would cost the manufacturer about1,000 jet deliveries over the next several years. Depending on size, Boeing jetliners sell for roughly $30million to nearly $200 million each. The company has said itneeds to shed workers to meet its stated goal of remainingprofitable despite the lost orders. Several airlines have already failed and others are said tobe teetering near bankruptcy in the wake of the hijackings,which boosted airlines' operating costs and left many of theirplanes half-empty. At the end of October, Boeing employed a total of 196,500workers and 91,600 in its Seattle-based commercial jet unit. The company expects to send out its next batch of 60-daylayoff notices on Dec. 21, Ryan said. ?2001 Reuters Limited.

Master Agreement: We need a parent guarantee from Genuity Inc. ($10MM) and are willing to reciprocate (Enron Corp. $10MM). We need to insert Events of Default with respect to guarantor. (Credit Support Annex section 4 and 5 from our MSA) We need to insert netting (MSA section 6.4) and close-out setoff (MSA section 5.7). We need to insert the ability to request financial statements from the Guarantor if they are not publicly available (MSA section 8). The assignment language needs to be re-amended. Both parties can only assign to an affiliate that is at least as creditworthy as the existing - i.e. we need to maintain the parent guarantee. (MSA section 10.4). The current amendment is unclear whether or not Genuity is the only party allowed to assign to an affiliate. We need a bilateral bankruptcy event of default. (MSA section 5.1(iv)). There is no clause regarding disputes of invoices. We can use our standard language from the MSA.(Section 6.3). Do we need to state that we are a forward contract merchant?

Reuters Boeing Sets 2,900 New Job Cuts Monday November 26, 1:36 PM EST SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing Co (BA). on Monday announced2,900 job cuts, boosting its total since the Sept. 11 hijackattacks to 14,900 or nearly half the 30,000 jobs it has said itcould cut by the end of 2002. The 2,900 employees getting 60-day layoff notices on Mondayincluded 2,100 in Boeing's beleaguered commercial jet unit,where orders have shriveled as airlines park aircraft and cutdeliveries of new jets to match shrinking air travel demand,spokesman Tom Ryan told Reuters. Chicago-based Boeing said the latest cuts also include 700workers in its shared services group and another 100 mostlyfrom its embryonic Connexion airborne Internet service and itsJoint Strike Fighter program, which lost a massive Pentagonaward to rival Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT). last month. The latest 2,900 cuts include 1,900 jobs in the Seattlearea, Ryan said. Boeing in October announced 12,000 job cuts, which takeeffect on Dec. 14, and said it would ultimately cut a total of20,000 to 30,000 workers. The first round included 11,400commercial airplane workers and 600 from shared services. Boeing also redeployed 200 of 600 Connexion workers in lateSeptember as airlines backed away from the service and Boeingfocused on flight safety and security applications for thesatellite-based communications network. The aerospace giant has slashed projected deliveries fromits world-leading commercial jet unit to 350 to 400 in 2002from an expected 522 this year. In 2003 the forecast falls evenlower and some industry analysts believe the totals will falleven lower. Earlier this month Boeing Chairman Phil Condit predictedthe current travel slump would cost the manufacturer about1,000 jet deliveries over the next several years. Depending on size, Boeing jetliners sell for roughly $30million to nearly $200 million each. The company has said itneeds to shed workers to meet its stated goal of remainingprofitable despite the lost orders. Several airlines have already failed and others are said tobe teetering near bankruptcy in the wake of the hijackings,which boosted airlines' operating costs and left many of theirplanes half-empty. At the end of October, Boeing employed a total of 196,500workers and 91,600 in its Seattle-based commercial jet unit. The company expects to send out its next batch of 60-daylayoff notices on Dec. 21, Ryan said. ?2001 Reuters Limited.

Reuters Boeing Sets 2,900 New Job Cuts Monday November 26, 1:36 PM EST SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing Co (BA). on Monday announced2,900 job cuts, boosting its total since the Sept. 11 hijackattacks to 14,900 or nearly half the 30,000 jobs it has said itcould cut by the end of 2002. The 2,900 employees getting 60-day layoff notices on Mondayincluded 2,100 in Boeing's beleaguered commercial jet unit,where orders have shriveled as airlines park aircraft and cutdeliveries of new jets to match shrinking air travel demand,spokesman Tom Ryan told Reuters. Chicago-based Boeing said the latest cuts also include 700workers in its shared services group and another 100 mostlyfrom its embryonic Connexion airborne Internet service and itsJoint Strike Fighter program, which lost a massive Pentagonaward to rival Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT). last month. The latest 2,900 cuts include 1,900 jobs in the Seattlearea, Ryan said. Boeing in October announced 12,000 job cuts, which takeeffect on Dec. 14, and said it would ultimately cut a total of20,000 to 30,000 workers. The first round included 11,400commercial airplane workers and 600 from shared services. Boeing also redeployed 200 of 600 Connexion workers in lateSeptember as airlines backed away from the service and Boeingfocused on flight safety and security applications for thesatellite-based communications network. The aerospace giant has slashed projected deliveries fromits world-leading commercial jet unit to 350 to 400 in 2002from an expected 522 this year. In 2003 the forecast falls evenlower and some industry analysts believe the totals will falleven lower. Earlier this month Boeing Chairman Phil Condit predictedthe current travel slump would cost the manufacturer about1,000 jet deliveries over the next several years. Depending on size, Boeing jetliners sell for roughly $30million to nearly $200 million each. The company has said itneeds to shed workers to meet its stated goal of remainingprofitable despite the lost orders. Several airlines have already failed and others are said tobe teetering near bankruptcy in the wake of the hijackings,which boosted airlines' operating costs and left many of theirplanes half-empty. At the end of October, Boeing employed a total of 196,500workers and 91,600 in its Seattle-based commercial jet unit. The company expects to send out its next batch of 60-daylayoff notices on Dec. 21, Ryan said. ?2001 Reuters Limited.

I need to determine if RAC believes that the 11/30/00 [Coral Energy] DASH is sufficient for the transaction signing to proceed tomorrow or if a revised DASH needs to be prepared and circulated for re-approval. Relative to the approved 11/30 DASH, the major changes in the deal structure are as follows: 1. At the request of Coral Energy, the counterparty to the proposed transaction has changed from Coral Energy to Intergen (or its designated affiliate, Sweetgum Energy L.P.). 2. Intergen has requested, and Enron has agreed, to the removal of the requirement for an Intergen Parent Guarantee. The major risk (i.e. non-payment risk) associated with the removal of this Guarantee has been mitigated by requiring Intergen to fund an escrow account with the transaction sales proceeds prior to Enron's execution of the equipment Assigment Agreement. 3. Intergen has requested, and Enron has agreed, to the insertion of a ""no-shop"" clause which serves to prevent Enron from offering/soliciting the turbines & transformers to other parties once Intergen has signed the Letter Agreement(s). 4. Enron has requested, and Intergen has not yet agreed, to the modification of the transaction ""sunset dates"". These are the dates by which, once the Letter Agreement is signed, that Enron must deliver the required Facilities Agreements, GE acknowledgement letter, and fully executed Assignment Agreement. This modification proposes that the dates be moved from 12/29/00 to 1/15/01. The Enron commercial deal team is awaiting confirmation from Enron Global Finance that the executed Assignment Agreement can be delivered within these timeframes. 5. Intergen has requested, and Enron has agreed, to a modification of the Transferability section of the Agreement in order to address an equipment warranty risk that the current language represents to Intergen. The modification would serve to limit Enron's ability to exercise its ""put option"" on its 20% member interest in the turbine/transformer L.L.C.(s) by requiring either: 1) the expiration of the GE warranty, or 2) the written consent of GE to Enron's ownership transfer in a form acceptable to Intergen. This modification is acceptable to Enron as it represents an earlier potential put option exercise date under scenario 1) above than the current Agreement language.

4499,06-07-2000 02:45:00,Re: ABB Agreement for Review,kay.mann@enron.com,lisa.bills@enron.com,"Lisa, Thank you for the timely comments. Credit support. On the issue of credit support for a project company partially owned by Enron, ABB has some concerns even when Enron still holds an equity interest due to some late payment problems they had in the past with an Enron project company. Also, the ABB and GE payment schedules are different, with GE being more front end loaded. For example, GE will have received 45% of the total payments due by the time the first 4 units are ready to ship; by the time the last 6 units are ready to ship, they will have received 95% of the payment. In contrast, we hold 25% of the price of each ABB unit until delivery (15%) and acceptance (10%) of that particular unit. Effective date. The typical reason for an earlier effective date is to capture any work which ABB may have chosen to do during the option period in order to hold their guaranteed completion dates. In the GE contract we addressed the issue in section 30.3, stating that it governs all work performed pursuant to the agreement in principle. It is fine with me to make the effective date a current one. Price change. I will confirm why the prices changed $78,000 from the latest option agreement. I suspect there were changes in the specifications since the data sheets have changed. Hope this was helpful. Kay Enron North America Corp.

This is not a GE requirement and it is a doubling up of Enron-type support which will make the venture much more expensive to finance. Purchase Agreement: Def. of Business Day: let's add New York since this is where WestLB funds from. 2.1(B): It should be ""Agent's"" person to approve change orders, not ""Purchaser's"" 2.2: ""Purchaser"" should be used rather than ""WestLB"" since it is not as limiting. 7.1: Why is the Effective Date backdated to the date of the first option agreement execution date? Exhibit N - Purchase Amount Reconciliation: The total amount of the three purchase amounts is $78M less than the same amounts detailed in the latest Option Agreement. I'd like to understand why this is, especially in light of the Effective Date in 7.1, to insure that AA won't determine that the Option Premiums paid were somehow a deposit or credit toward the purchase price of the transformers.

My understanding of the commercial deal is that the scope should include change order #3, with 75% of the value of change order #3 payable on or before Dec. 27, 2000, and 25% of change order #3 being added to the January, 2000 payment. Kent/Lee, sorry I didn't mention this in our phone call this afternoon. That's what happens when I'm not working from my list. Thanks, Kay"

I was assigned to the project in late June 2000 and do not have any inspection, shipping / receipts, or etc. at this time. I do have a QA/QC inspector on this project to ensure Enron and CALME get a quality turbine for their money. I am also working on an AFE to cover the expenses of this work from July 2000 until the turbine is turned over to a dedicated project site. This cost will include proper storage of the GTG and inspections so we do not have another debacle like the Iuka, MS frame 6B's. At the present, I anticipate the cost to be from $50,000 to $75,000 till the end of this year. Any money left over will be carried over into the following year or rebated when the turbine is turned over to a dedicated project site (i.e. CALME will only need to cover what is actually spent). The only deviation to the contract that I am aware of is the change order for the duel fuel option. I believe that other changes are being negotiated, but I am unaware of the content of those changes, if any, at this time. To begin the summary, the gas turbine is in the Houston, Texas Powerserve shop going through final assembly. The turbine is expected to ship to the delivery point (Port of Houston) by mid to late September, 2000. The generator is a different story. It was shipped from Nasan, South Korea on 8 JUN 00. It arrived in the Port of Houston on or about 23 JUL 00. As the cargo ship was off-loading it's cargo, the ship listed to one side. The crew went to re-balast the ship; however they did not close certain valves, or something to that effect, and flooded the cargo bay containing our generator. When the mistake was realized, 19 inches of seawater was in and around the generator. The water touched the parallel rings but not the core of the generator. Talking with Lynn DeKrey, Westinghouse Project Manager, he informed us that Westinghouse engineering has declared the generator non-salvageable. Lynn is currently gathering information so we can claim an insurable event occurred as well as trying to find us a generator as soon as possible. Lynn is also going to send an accident report so we may evaluate the damage as well. We have not accepted delivery of the generator and turbine; furthermore, title has not been transferred to Enron. I have alerted Dan Shultz, Brian Barto, and Dwight Alexander of these events. In short, the Westinghouse 501D5A WILL NOT be available, as a GTG set, in September 2000. Options to repair the generator were discussed with Lynn and it is estimated to take anywhere from six to twelve months and cost $3.5 to $5 million dollars. The next option is to take delivery of an Erferd generator from Germany in late July, 2001. The last option, which Lynn is currently working, is to supply a generator in sufficient time for a Commercial Operation Date of June 1, 2000. If you have any questions, or would like me to speak with you further on this, please feel free to contact me at 713-646-8258.

I was assigned to the project in late June 2000 and do not have any inspection, shipping / receipts, or etc. at this time. I do have a QA/QC inspector on this project to ensure Enron and CALME get a quality turbine for their money. I am also working on an AFE to cover the expenses of this work from July 2000 until the turbine is turned over to a dedicated project site. This cost will include proper storage of the GTG and inspections so we do not have another debacle like the Iuka, MS frame 6B's. At the present, I anticipate the cost to be from $50,000 to $75,000 till the end of this year. Any money left over will be carried over into the following year or rebated when the turbine is turned over to a dedicated project site (i.e. CALME will only need to cover what is actually spent).

Regarding Tim's addition of the second and third sentences to my original suggested language, it appears that there may be a misunderstanding. Under Mexican tax law, EEIM would be obligated to withhold tax on any payments it makes to GE that are subject to Mexican withholding tax. EEIM would submit such amounts directly to the Mexican tax authorities and, in exchange, would receive an official receipt (Official Form 37-A) that it could then forward to GE. It appears that Tim wants to ensure that GE obtains a copy of the official receipt so that GE can claim a foreign tax credit on its U.S. income tax return for any withholding tax to which payments it receives are subject under Mexican tax law. Tim's suggested additional language therefore needs to modified to reflect that EEIM would pay the tax and could then provide GE with the receipt. I'd be glad to visit with Tim to discuss this matter. 2. The language that I have proposed should be inserted in both the onshore agreement and the offshore agreement. Tim is proposing that it be inserted (with his additional suggestions) only in the onshore agreement. Please contact me at ext. 35777 if you have any questions.

From: Lisa Bills 07/14/2000 08:52 PM To: Kay Mann/Corp/Enron@Enron, Laura Luce/Corp/Enron@Enron, Fred Mitro/HOU/ECT@ECT, Rusty Stevens/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Gregg Penman/Corp/Enron@Enron, Thomas Suffield/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Eric LeDain/CAL/ECT@ECT, Greg Johnston/CAL/ECT@ECT, Herman Manis/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Roger Ondreko/HOU/ECT@ECT, Roseann Engeldorf/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc: Kate Chaney/CAL/ECT@ECT, Morris Richard Clark/HOU/ECT@ECT, Chip Schneider/NA/Enron@Enron, Matthew Berry/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Re: Peoples document I have reviewed the below document provided by Kay Mann. While I realize the Chicago team is trying to proceed in an expeditious manner, there are concerns within the document which affect the financing and accounting treatment of Canada's Project Moore. The items discussed below are focused on the 2 ABB turbines Enron Canada is interested in potentially acquiring. From an accounting perspective (Herman and Roger, please correct me where I misstate something we talked about this afternoon): * Any payment amount provided to PERC from an Enron entity must be in the form of an option premium. If an Enron entity were to make any other type of payment to PERC associated with the purchase of the turbines, it would be considered a hard cost and the turbines would be put on Enron's balance sheet. Once there, they could not be used in Project Moore since that Project must be kept off balance sheet. * Enron Canada cannot just step into PERC's shoes under the WestLB Documents and Turbine Contract. These documents were entered into at the beginning of 2000 and approved by PERC's accountants. The AA team for Enron has been reviewing a considerable number of both sets of documents and the required language has changed quite a bit on both from early 2000. Therefore, both the WestLB Documents and the Turbine Contract will need to be amended to receive AA's approval to keep the turbines off Enron's balance sheet. From a financing perspective: * We are currently working at providing a Canadian lease structure for Project Moore. From a cost perspective it would be best to wait until the structure is in place and have it purchase the turbines from WestLB/PERC. Without the DASH approved, the turbines will not be able to be purchased, no matter the Purchaser. From the latest information I have, it appears that the DASH is scheduled to be presented to the Board approx. Aug 7th. The Canadian structure should be ready shortly thereafter. If there is a timing differential, our existing WestLB facility for Project Moore can be expanded to house the PERC turbines along with the existing N1s until the Canadian vehicle is ready. This will be more expensive for Enron Canada than waiting until the Canadian vehicle is in place to purchase the PERC turbines since there will be two upfront ""structuring"" fees to be paid by Enron Canada. Given that the WestLB documents with Enron have already been negotiated and approved by AA, this appears to be a better alternative than ""stepping into"" PERC's shoes under their WestLB Documents and negotiating everything again. As for the Turbine Contract, it will need to be modified regardless of who the Purchaser is - WestLB or the Canadian vehicle. * I realize PERC would like to keep all the potential deals wrapped together since they all involve Calumet Power LLC. However, given the requirements for keeping the PERC turbines off Enron's balance sheet, it would seem to be cleaner for these turbines to be carved out and have Enron Canada enter into a separate Option Agreement with PERC, subject to satisfaction of conditions precedent, for the potential purchase of the turbines. We have entered into several option agreements with vendors recently so the documentation is pretty standard and can be approved by AA quickly. Although PERC would like a firm commitment from Enron, this will be difficult without the DASH being approved. At the same time, PERC and ENA can continue to negotiate a contract for the rest of the potential transactions. As for the rest of the Assignment and Option Agreement, I apologize for being out of the loop but would someone please update me on how you see these transactions being financed. I want to insure that Finance and Accounting are up to speed with these transactions so that if ENA does move forward, it is a smooth process and balance sheet favorable. I look forward to working with the team on finalizing the agreement(s) for PERC's review on Monday. Enron North America Corp.

In the writ, the court very unambiguously and very plainly commands that EECC is not to pay any debt or deliver any property to CIGSA pending further orders from the court. The writ was issued to enforce an judgment for $1.3 million awarded by the court against CIGSA in favor of Richard P Estrada. EECC is also commanded to appear before the court and list all funds/assets in our possession that might belong to CIGSA, and to disclose what other persons we know ofif any, that might have such funds or assets. The lawyer for Mr. Estrada is the same lawyer who successfully garnished EECC in the past to collect sums owed other CIGSA judgment creditors. Please take this prohibition as applying even to cases where CIGSA might be entitled to the money or the property under our contracts with them, or where the funds or property are in joint venture acounts or custody in the US or Mexico until we have had a chance to review matters in detail and make a more accurate assessment. In the meantime, effective immediately, do not make ANY payments to or on behalf of, or release ANY property to or on behalf of, any CIGSA entity without first obtaining legal department approval. The court may impose penalties for violations of its garnishment order. We will assemble an appropriate litigation team to work onthis matter. Randy Pais will be handling this for EEOS legal.

Also, please note that our accounting group has also blessed this agreement. As a summary, the substantive changes that I made are as follows: - Article 1 now more specifically describes the standards by which Trinity will perform its services (these changes should be a non-issue) - Article 3 now imposes certain conflict of interest obligations on Trinity. 3.1 obligates them to represent and warrant that their entry into an agreement with us will not breach any other obligations that would otherwise have to other parties. 3.3 imposes the obligation on them to obtain our prior consent before they perform any work for any third party or government agency that would have ""an adverse effect"" on us (this is direct change from their form which had no such obligation but which is standard in our consulting agreements and is a reasonable request.) - Article 4 adds our standard language that Contractor is an independent contractor and not entitled to any of our employment benefits. - Article 5, inserted a 2 year term. - Article 6 inserted that payments are within 30 days and that reimbursements must be in advance. Please note that since I cannot edit the Price Schedule, then conforming changes to it need to be made, including whether to strike the 18% interest charge for late payments and whether to accept the 15% out-of-pocket surcharge (neither of which is in our standard agreement). I also inserted your name for invoices. - Article 7 added a termination event that the breach of the conflict of interest or confidentiality obligations is an immediate event of termination. - Article 8, inserted your name for notices with a copy to me in the legal department. - Article 9, I revised the liability limitation to make it reciprocal and excluded from the liability limitation, damages that would arise from Trinity's breaches of Section 3.1 (that entering into this agreement will not breach any other agreements that they have), Article 10 (indemnification for personal injury or death claims attributable to them), Section 12.2 (not providing us with information that violates someone else's intellectual property rights) and Section 13 (non-disclosure / confidentiality obligations). Note that although accepting a liability limitation is not standard per our agreements, by making the foregoing exceptions, the liability limitation that we are effectively agreeing to is only with respect to any ""malpractice"" claims that we would have against them if their work was not up to industry standards. - Article 10, this is an indemnification provision which obligates them to indemnify us for personal injury or death claims attributable to them. - Article 11, states that the ownership of work product developed will be ours and that they will not provide us with any information etc. that they do not have the intellectual property rights ownership of. - Section 13.4 are certain procedures to be observed in the event that a court requires the production of confidential information (the text is standard boilerplate.) - Article 14 states that they have all liceneses to perform the work and to the extent that any are needed they will obtain them at their own cost and expense. - Article 15 is our standard boilerplate. - Formerly Article 12 on Non-Solicitation of Employees - per our discussion this has been struck - Section 17.1 now imposes venue in Harris County, Texas not Dallas County. - Section 17.2 allows us to assign the agreement to any of our affiliates without their consent but subject to notifying them of the assignment - Section 17.8 requires our consent before they use Enron's name in any advertising - Exhibit A terms and conditions have all been struck since those duplicated what was in the Master Agreement.

If it is, then what obligation does NCNG have with respect to the construction of a delivery point. I haven't reviewed the annexation statutes yet, but based on my initial reading of the Service Area Territory Agreement between Rocky Mount and NCNG, once annexed the site would come within Rocky Mount's purview to serve, and, although a ""mutually agreeable"" delivery point would have to be negotiated, NCNG would at least have to negotiate that in good faith. The January 13, 1992 Service Area Territory Agreement gives Rocky Mount the right to distribute natural gas within the city's incorporated limits as well as a specified area outside the incorporated limits. The contract goes on to provide that should any part of that perimeter be annexed into the city, ""the respective rights of the parties as to service in any such portion shall be determined by applicable case law and the General Statutes of North Carolina. . ."" The contract further provides that absent an order of the NCUC to the contrary, NCNG agrees that Rocky Mount has the right to serve all end users within the ""aforementioned"" area--presumably referring to the annexed area, although the agreement is not a model of clarity. So, at least based on this language, Rocky Mount's right to serve arguably tracks its incorporated limits, whatever they might be. (Jonathan and I are looking at annexation law to see what else might be lurking out there).

In the Third Amendment to the Natural Gas Service Agreement, dated March 10, 1997, new language and delivery points are negotiated upon, but the principle is still included that other stations may be added at ""mutually agreeable locations in the future.""

The next two changes are the typo we discussed in paragraph 3 and an additional sentence at the end of that paragraph.

It is very rare that the WSJ with its conservative bent and with a Republican President writes this type of Op-Ed. Nevertheless, the article already sets the predicate of Lay's defense that he did not fully comprehend what was going on and, thus, lacked the mens rea for the crimes that Skilling and Fastow will be charged with. REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial) Investigating Enron 11/30/2001 The Wall Street Journal A14 (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) You can cut the Schadenfreude with a machete these days as Enron careens toward failure. Like any fast-rising, innovative business, the energy trader made enemies, some with a fair grievance and some not. We hope the inevitable (and necessary) investigations keep in mind the difference. Enron was a forthright advocate of competition, as every obituary of the past few days has noted. Some see the firm's collapse as discrediting the market economics it championed, though the opposite is closer to the truth. It strikes us that Enron was partly a victim of its own success. Its revenues quadrupled in a year, thanks to the fillip that California's troubles provided to the wholesale power market. But profits were up much less -- i.e., Enron was earning thinner margins in the energy-trading business it pioneered. The new industry quickly became too competitive and transparent to afford any windfalls, just as deregulation admirers would have predicted. Enron does not own U.S. power plants and generally did not seem to make outsized profits on power for resale in, say, California. But that didn't stop California's eccentric attorney general, Bill Lockyer, from blaming Enron CEO Ken Lay for that state's electricity mismanagement. Last summer he told a Wall Street Journal reporter that, ""I would love to personally escort Lay to an 8x10 cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says, `Hi my name is Spike, honey.'"" Consider that an unfair grievance. Accounting matters are more troubling. The struggle for a century has been to make sure corporate managers don't pursue their own agendas at the expense of owners. The emergence of special partnerships, controlled and owned by Enron's own senior officers, with which the company did some of its murkiest deals, would cause even libertarians to wonder what's been going on. Clearly Mr. Lay didn't fully understand what former Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling was up to, and shareholders weren't told either. At the same time, Enron officers had a large amount of personal wealth tied up in Enron stock, which has fallen from $90 to 61 cents. So the mere existence of these partnership deals does not automatically indicate corrupt intent. Only a detailed investigation can resolve whether these deals were honestly motivated, and whether Enron's (and Arthur Andersen's) interpretation of accounting rules was defensible. In any case, trial lawyers will descend to squeeze every penny out of Enron's troubles for themselves (and for shareholders or employees who held Enron stock in their 401(k)s). As for the investigations, we hope they won't be influenced one way or another by long connections between Mr. Lay and President Bush. Even the hint of special treatment would be a political disaster, especially for an Administration that promised to clean up after Bill Clinton. While tradition has been not to make criminal matters out of accounting scandals, exceptions have arisen recently. Federal prosecutors in New York have gone after Walter Forbes, who sold his company to Cendant, giving rise to what before Enron was the nation's most costly stock meltdown due to bad accounting. San Francisco prosecutors recently extracted guilty pleas from executives of Aurora Foods over their treatment of trade promotion expenses for their portfolio of ""orphan"" brands as capital expenditures. Enron is an opportunity for the Bush team to show it can police similar financial chicanery, if some is found.

Nevertheless, the article already sets the predicate of Lay's defense that he did not fully comprehend what was going on and, thus, lacked the mens rea for the crimes that Skilling and Fastow will be charged with. REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial) Investigating Enron 11/30/2001 The Wall Street Journal A14 (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) You can cut the Schadenfreude with a machete these days as Enron careens toward failure. Like any fast-rising, innovative business, the energy trader made enemies, some with a fair grievance and some not. We hope the inevitable (and necessary) investigations keep in mind the difference. Enron was a forthright advocate of competition, as every obituary of the past few days has noted. Some see the firm's collapse as discrediting the market economics it championed, though the opposite is closer to the truth. It strikes us that Enron was partly a victim of its own success. Its revenues quadrupled in a year, thanks to the fillip that California's troubles provided to the wholesale power market. But profits were up much less -- i.e., Enron was earning thinner margins in the energy-trading business it pioneered. The new industry quickly became too competitive and transparent to afford any windfalls, just as deregulation admirers would have predicted. Enron does not own U.S. power plants and generally did not seem to make outsized profits on power for resale in, say, California. But that didn't stop California's eccentric attorney general, Bill Lockyer, from blaming Enron CEO Ken Lay for that state's electricity mismanagement. Last summer he told a Wall Street Journal reporter that, ""I would love to personally escort Lay to an 8x10 cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says, `Hi my name is Spike, honey.'"" Consider that an unfair grievance. Accounting matters are more troubling. The struggle for a century has been to make sure corporate managers don't pursue their own agendas at the expense of owners. The emergence of special partnerships, controlled and owned by Enron's own senior officers, with which the company did some of its murkiest deals, would cause even libertarians to wonder what's been going on. Clearly Mr. Lay didn't fully understand what former Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling was up to, and shareholders weren't told either. At the same time, Enron officers had a large amount of personal wealth tied up in Enron stock, which has fallen from $90 to 61 cents. So the mere existence of these partnership deals does not automatically indicate corrupt intent. Only a detailed investigation can resolve whether these deals were honestly motivated, and whether Enron's (and Arthur Andersen's) interpretation of accounting rules was defensible. In any case, trial lawyers will descend to squeeze every penny out of Enron's troubles for themselves (and for shareholders or employees who held Enron stock in their 401(k)s). As for the investigations, we hope they won't be influenced one way or another by long connections between Mr. Lay and President Bush. Even the hint of special treatment would be a political disaster, especially for an Administration that promised to clean up after Bill Clinton. While tradition has been not to make criminal matters out of accounting scandals, exceptions have arisen recently. Federal prosecutors in New York have gone after Walter Forbes, who sold his company to Cendant, giving rise to what before Enron was the nation's most costly stock meltdown due to bad accounting. San Francisco prosecutors recently extracted guilty pleas from executives of Aurora Foods over their treatment of trade promotion expenses for their portfolio of ""orphan"" brands as capital expenditures. Enron is an opportunity for the Bush team to show it can police similar financial chicanery, if some is found. Sorting the capitalists from the crooks is one way of protecting capitalism."

I need Enron to confirm several items in the escrow agreement: In Part I, Section 2, the escrow agent is directed (in the absence of written instructions) to invest 50% of the funds in the Dreyfus Money Market Fund titled Cash Management Investors Class (670) and 50% of the funds in Treasury Cash Management Investor Class (673). Please confirm that these investment instructions are acceptable to Enron. Part I, Section 4 of the escrow agreement contains wiring instructions for Enron. Please confirm that these instructions indicate the proper account for wire transfers by the escrow agent to Enron. The fee schedule proposed by Citibank calls for payment by Enron of a $2,500 acceptance fee, an $8,000 flat annual administration fee, and legal fees of Citibank at cost.

Reuters Boeing Sets 2,900 New Job Cuts Monday November 26, 1:36 PM EST SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing Co (BA). on Monday announced2,900 job cuts, boosting its total since the Sept. 11 hijackattacks to 14,900 or nearly half the 30,000 jobs it has said itcould cut by the end of 2002. The 2,900 employees getting 60-day layoff notices on Mondayincluded 2,100 in Boeing's beleaguered commercial jet unit,where orders have shriveled as airlines park aircraft and cutdeliveries of new jets to match shrinking air travel demand,spokesman Tom Ryan told Reuters. Chicago-based Boeing said the latest cuts also include 700workers in its shared services group and another 100 mostlyfrom its embryonic Connexion airborne Internet service and itsJoint Strike Fighter program, which lost a massive Pentagonaward to rival Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT). last month. The latest 2,900 cuts include 1,900 jobs in the Seattlearea, Ryan said. Boeing in October announced 12,000 job cuts, which takeeffect on Dec. 14, and said it would ultimately cut a total of20,000 to 30,000 workers. The first round included 11,400commercial airplane workers and 600 from shared services. Boeing also redeployed 200 of 600 Connexion workers in lateSeptember as airlines backed away from the service and Boeingfocused on flight safety and security applications for thesatellite-based communications network. The aerospace giant has slashed projected deliveries fromits world-leading commercial jet unit to 350 to 400 in 2002from an expected 522 this year. In 2003 the forecast falls evenlower and some industry analysts believe the totals will falleven lower. Earlier this month Boeing Chairman Phil Condit predictedthe current travel slump would cost the manufacturer about1,000 jet deliveries over the next several years. Depending on size, Boeing jetliners sell for roughly $30million to nearly $200 million each. The company has said itneeds to shed workers to meet its stated goal of remainingprofitable despite the lost orders. Several airlines have already failed and others are said tobe teetering near bankruptcy in the wake of the hijackings,which boosted airlines' operating costs and left many of theirplanes half-empty. At the end of October, Boeing employed a total of 196,500workers and 91,600 in its Seattle-based commercial jet unit. The company expects to send out its next batch of 60-daylayoff notices on Dec. 21, Ryan said. ?2001 Reuters Limited.

SWPC further acknowledges that the assignment of the contracts and the transfer of equity will not impact any warranties or other provisions of the assigned contracts. How does this sound?

They requested something along the lines of what is in the email you forwarded, but I believe they accepted the following language: SWPC agrees that the Gleason and Wheatland contracts and associated warranties may be assigned to limited liability companies owned in whole or in part by an Enron entity pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Gleason and Wheatland contracts, and that Enron will not be required to maintain an equity position in either of these companies. SWPC further acknowledges that the assignment of the contracts and the transfer of equity will not impact any warranties or other provisions of the assigned contracts. How does this sound?

I didn't suggest you get involved, and as you can see I wasn't copied on any of the arrangements ( until you forwarded them to me ). I think this is by design, as Ozzie has asked that I focus my time on finalizing arrangements with FPUA, FMPA and Turbo Park.

The assignment clause in the GE Terms and Conditions currently permits the assignment by the buyer to an affiliate without GE's consent. The word affiliate is not defined but we should be able to take the position, as a 49% equity owner in East Coast Power, that it is an El Paso affiliate. I would recommend that to clarify, we include the following clause after the word affiliate in the Assignment Section: (including but not limited to East Coast Power L.L.C.). Andrew, Bob and Coralyn, pls advise if you would like to take a different approach. I also expect that we will have a credit issue when the Contract is assigned to ECP as GE is now, I believe, getting an El Paso Energy Corp. Guaranty. According to Bob Licato at ECP, GE accepted an ECP assignment without an Enron guaranty on Linden 6 due in part to the presence of GECC as a lender/equity participant in ECP. We can discuss this with GE when we inform them of the planned assignment to ECP. Finally, I would advise that when we get GE to sign a letter accepting the assignment, we confirm that the GE warranties flow to ECP. ****************************************************************** This email and any files transmitted with it from El Paso Energy Corporation are confidential and intended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they are addressed.

Also, please note that our accounting group has also blessed this agreement. As a summary, the substantive changes that I made are as follows: - Article 1 now more specifically describes the standards by which Trinity will perform its services (these changes should be a non-issue) - Article 3 now imposes certain conflict of interest obligations on Trinity. 3.1 obligates them to represent and warrant that their entry into an agreement with us will not breach any other obligations that would otherwise have to other parties. 3.3 imposes the obligation on them to obtain our prior consent before they perform any work for any third party or government agency that would have ""an adverse effect"" on us (this is direct change from their form which had no such obligation but which is standard in our consulting agreements and is a reasonable request.) - Article 4 adds our standard language that Contractor is an independent contractor and not entitled to any of our employment benefits. - Article 5, inserted a 2 year term. - Article 6 inserted that payments are within 30 days and that reimbursements must be in advance. Please note that since I cannot edit the Price Schedule, then conforming changes to it need to be made, including whether to strike the 18% interest charge for late payments and whether to accept the 15% out-of-pocket surcharge (neither of which is in our standard agreement). I also inserted your name for invoices. - Article 7 added a termination event that the breach of the conflict of interest or confidentiality obligations is an immediate event of termination. - Article 8, inserted your name for notices with a copy to me in the legal department. - Article 9, I revised the liability limitation to make it reciprocal and excluded from the liability limitation, damages that would arise from Trinity's breaches of Section 3.1 (that entering into this agreement will not breach any other agreements that they have), Article 10 (indemnification for personal injury or death claims attributable to them), Section 12.2 (not providing us with information that violates someone else's intellectual property rights) and Section 13 (non-disclosure / confidentiality obligations). Note that although accepting a liability limitation is not standard per our agreements, by making the foregoing exceptions, the liability limitation that we are effectively agreeing to is only with respect to any ""malpractice"" claims that we would have against them if their work was not up to industry standards. - Article 10, this is an indemnification provision which obligates them to indemnify us for personal injury or death claims attributable to them. - Article 11, states that the ownership of work product developed will be ours and that they will not provide us with any information etc. that they do not have the intellectual property rights ownership of. - Section 13.4 are certain procedures to be observed in the event that a court requires the production of confidential information (the text is standard boilerplate.) - Article 14 states that they have all liceneses to perform the work and to the extent that any are needed they will obtain them at their own cost and expense. - Article 15 is our standard boilerplate. - Formerly Article 12 on Non-Solicitation of Employees - per our discussion this has been struck - Section 17.1 now imposes venue in Harris County, Texas not Dallas County. - Section 17.2 allows us to assign the agreement to any of our affiliates without their consent but subject to notifying them of the assignment - Section 17.8 requires our consent before they use Enron's name in any advertising - Exhibit A terms and conditions have all been struck since those duplicated what was in the Master Agreement.
