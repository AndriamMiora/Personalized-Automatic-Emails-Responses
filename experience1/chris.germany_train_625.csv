Please let me know how you think we could best deal with these - whether it's via phone call or having an in-person meeting down in your office. 1. Pricing - I left you a message about this last week. According to Chris Germany, all changes to volumes after first-of-the-month must me negotiated. In the contract, however, it specifically refers to pricing intra-month using gas daily OR negotiated pricing depending on the timing of the change. 2. Consistency - During our discussions with Chris, it sounds as though some pipes are being handled differently than others again as it relates to intra-month changes. I'd just like to make sure that we agree on the pricing mechanism and then apply it consistently. 3. Local production - Apparently there was local production that John Singer purchased specifically to back Retail customers, and this production was not removed from the Wholesale book prior to the sale. We need to discuss how to handle this production. 4. Monthly invoices - We still haven't seen the complete January 2000 invoice. As I understand it, the demand charges have not all been sent over, and several items that need to be changed haven't yet been changed. Also, Brian Perrone and Charlie Dalphon have indicated that they have requested back-up documentation on the demand charges, but we still haven't received anything. 5. Swap confirmations - For all of the swaps that Clay Deaton put in place with Enron to keep Retail's existing hedge positions in tact, I still do not have executed copies of all of the confirmation agreements. Rich Contos and I have both called several people about getting a complete set of copies, but we can't seem to find the right person over there.

Laurie has been asking for quite some time about an imbalance trade behind NIMO. As you can see, I did my usual ignore it and maybe it will go away but its not working.

Your book which had Friday's P&L of ($2,240) was making $131,808 due to physical deals movement. So we had to tranfer the difference of $134,048 from your book to Scott Neal's to bring you back at Friday's P&L.

On Monday you would have recovered that physical loss but several deals Sitara 636796, 636821, 646038 were changed on Monday resulting in taking the Sunday's gain away from your book.

Your book which had Friday's P&L of ($2,240) was making $131,808 due to physical deals movement. So we had to tranfer the difference of $134,048 from your book to Scott Neal's to bring you back at Friday's P&L. This hit came in your Nymex book in March causing you to lose more than you think in Nymex. On Monday you would have recovered that physical loss but several deals Sitara 636796, 636821, 646038 were changed on Monday resulting in taking the Sunday's gain away from your book.

Got a problem on PSNC for March 1st. I had requested 145 dth per day on Doug's spreadsheet and notified my Transco scheduler. For some reason Chris Germany told PSNC to release capacity for 190 dth and not 145 dth. PSNC called me and asked if I wanted to have the capacity recalled. I instructed PSNC to contact Chris.

This morning I got a call from PSNC telling me we have a problem with March 1st, that only 145 dth could be confirmed. I called my transco scheduler and she told me that Chris told her that CES had the capacity recalled. (impossible as capacity was released to Enron). All I wanted was 145 dth per day for March.

FINE ~ This is the word we use at the end of any argument that we feel we are right about but need to shut you up. NEVER use fine to describe how a woman looks. This will cause you to have one of those arguments. FIVE MINUTES ~ This is half an hour. It is equivalent to the five minutes that your football game is going to last before you take out the trash, so I feel that it's an even trade. NOTHING ~ If you ask her what is wrong and she says NOTHING, this means something and you should be on your toes. NOTHING is usually used to describe the feeling a woman has of wanting to turn you inside out, upside down, and backwards. ""Nothing"" usually signifies an argument that will last FIVE MINUTES and end with the word FINE. GO AHEAD (with raised eyebrows) ~ This is a dare. One that will result in a woman getting upset over NOTHING and will end with the word FINE. GO AHEAD (normal eyebrows) ~ This means ""I give up"" or ""do what you want because I don't care."" You will get a raised eyebrow ""Go ahead"" in just a few minutes, followed by NOTHING and FINE and she will talk to you in about FIVE MINUTES when she cools off. LOUD SIGH ~ This is not actually a word, but is still often a verbal statement very misunderstood by men. A ""Loud Sigh"" means she thinks you are an idiot at that moment and wonders why she is wasting her time standing here and arguing with you over NOTHING. SOFT SIGH ~ Again, not a word, but a verbal statement. ""Soft Sighs"" are one of the few things that some men actually understand. She is content. Your best bet is to not move or breathe and she will stay content. THAT'S OKAY ~ This is one of the most dangerous statements that a woman can say to a man. ""That's Okay"" means that she wants to think long and hard before paying you retributions for whatever it is that you! have done. ""That's Okay"" is often used with the word ""Fine"" and used in conjunction with a raised eyebrow ""Go ahead."" At some point in the near future when she has plotted and planned, you are going to be in some mighty big trouble. PLEASE DO ~ This is not a statement, it is an offer. A woman is giving you the chance to come up with whatever excuse or reason you have for doing whatever it is that you have done. You have a fair chance to tell the truth, so be careful and you shouldn't get a ""That's Okay."" THANKS ~ A woman is thanking you. Do not faint; just say ""you're welcome."" THANKS A LOT ~ This is much different from ""Thanks."" A woman will say, ""Thanks A Lot"" when she is really ticked off at you. It signifies that you have hurt her in some callous way, and will be followed by the ""Loud Sigh."" Be careful not to ask what is wrong after the ""Loud Sigh,"" as she will only tell you ""Nothing.""

Subject: Termination / Release letters for Producers on Dominion Transmission Kay - Thanks for your attention and assistance in this matter. Several gas producers are flowing gas through Dominion Transmission pipeline to Enron's pool. They have terminated their contracts with Enron, or have sent documents to us to terminate their contracts with Enron. They are calling now requesting letters confirming termination of their contracts and/or letters releasing their gas on Dominion Transmission's pipe from Enron's pool in order to satisfy Dominion Transmission's requirement for proof of termination and/or release of gas back to the producers. Dominion Transmission is holding these producers' gas and is not letting the producers sell their gas to other buyers. I have been trying for the last three weeks to discover the route these requests need to pass through in order to get the aforementioned termination and release notices. I have met with little success and fewer answers. Prior to my being involved, Nelson Ferries had forwarded a few requests through Contracts and Legal and had Fred Lagrasta sign off on them. I also talked to several people last week in Contracts and Legal asking for help, but a process does not seem to be in place. Please advise as to how quickly we can act on these requests. Producers are fearful of not being able to sell their January 2002 gas (ie. not getting paid) and are facing severe financial hardships. Please advise as to what I can provide or help out with this process. A list of producers is provided below. I am sure more producers will call.

That works out to about 429 day. I just spoke to Samson and he agrees the volume for July should only be 4,000 for the month. AND Angie (my super fantastic, can't say enough good things about her, will probably be my boss someday and sometimes acts like it, CNG scheduler) has agreed to help out any way she can. She knows escript pretty well. Chat with Doug, if you guys agree, Angie can use your ID and password and figure out how to run all the reports we need back to January. Also, we will not know the actuals for July production until September sometime. Effective August 1st, the Phillip's wells should be transferred to Clinton's brand new pool and Clinton will also nominate the Power Gas pool gas.

Did you guys do a deal for this gas too? He usually nominates it all on one day, so Clinton/CES needs to coordinate with him what day to do it on (right now the gas is out there on his side on the 17th). I know Heidi nominated the Phillips gas baseloaded thru the month at 443/day, but I was not sure about the Power, until I checked and sure enough the nom isn't out there yet. I can get help nominating it from PNG to get it through CES' pool but I want to make sure that's what we need to do.

That works out to about 429 day. I just spoke to Samson and he agrees the volume for July should only be 4,000 for the month. AND Angie (my super fantastic, can't say enough good things about her, will probably be my boss someday and sometimes acts like it, CNG scheduler) has agreed to help out any way she can. She knows escript pretty well. Chat with Doug, if you guys agree, Angie can use your ID and password and figure out how to run all the reports we need back to January. Also, we will not know the actuals for July production until September sometime. Effective August 1st, the Phillip's wells should be transferred to Clinton's brand new pool and Clinton will also nominate the Power Gas pool gas. Doug, John Singer said he does not have any production reports from Heidi. With Angie's help, we could probably clear up the CNG LDC activity fairly easy.

Did you guys do a deal for this gas too? He usually nominates it all on one day, so Clinton/CES needs to coordinate with him what day to do it on (right now the gas is out there on his side on the 17th). I know Heidi nominated the Phillips gas baseloaded thru the month at 443/day, but I was not sure about the Power, until I checked and sure enough the nom isn't out there yet. I can get help nominating it from PNG to get it through CES' pool but I want to make sure that's what we need to do. Just give me the word and I will call Sampson to get it done, but I will make it clear to him that this is the last month he'll need to talk to me about it. Thank you very much for the clarifications! Kara D. aka the lone ranger at CES"

Peoples Gas invoices ENA about $400.00 a month for a License Fee, Customer Service Charge, and taxes and it looks like we have not paid this bill for the last 3 months. In the pre-petition world, we used this ID to do nominations on the Peoples Gas system. We are not currently using this ID and it looks like we no longer need an ID for this system. BUT, Kevin Brady, an ENA scheduler, uses an Enovate and EMW LLC id to do nominations for those companies. Enovate is paying the invoices for those companies. Can we cancel this ID, or should we just tell Peoples we are not going to pay the invoice and let them terminate the ID at their discretion?

The buyer pays the seller the amount of the GST which is a per cent of the purchase price. The seller, in turn, remits the amount of the GST to the appropriate Canadian authority. In structuring the deal, be sure that you make it clear that the Contract Price does not include the GST. If the gas it to be exported the buyer needs to notify that the gas is ""zero-rated"" so it is not subject to the GST. Wade - Do you know who in settlements is handling GST payments?

Sent: Wednesday, February 27, 2002 3:34 PM To: Mann, Kay; Germany, Chris Cc: Price, Wade R. Subject: RE: Enbridge Consumers' Gas Park & Loan The Goods and Services Tax (GST) in Canada is levied on sales of gas at a delivery point in Canada and where the gas will not be exported from Canada. The buyer pays the seller the amount of the GST which is a per cent of the purchase price. The seller, in turn, remits the amount of the GST to the appropriate Canadian authority. In structuring the deal, be sure that you make it clear that the Contract Price does not include the GST. If the gas it to be exported the buyer needs to notify that the gas is ""zero-rated"" so it is not subject to the GST. Wade - Do you know who in settlements is handling GST payments? I hope we still have someone who can do that. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

If NiSource wants to recall, I do not believe it will create a problem. Kim Olinger is coordinating all the Logistics activities for the wholesale desk. (Kim...would you please confirm....). It's important to note, that if ENA wants to keep this capacity, they must pay in full the outstanding indebtedness, together with accrued interest at the Commission approved interest rate, and furnish adequate assurance of payment to Releasor if required by the Releasor w/n 24 hours of being notified. Since this message was not received from Nisource until 3:08 p.m. 1/31/02........ officially, Nisource can not recall the capacity until the evening cycle of 2/1/02. I do want you to know that EES is actively nominating on Columbia Gas Transmission to the Columbia Gas of Ohio and PA markets. If we receive any notice of capacity recall on EES capacity, we will want to react and it will be critical to communicate this notification to me ASAP.

We have not made any payments since we filed bankruptcy for pre or post petition activity at the direction of management. When I spoke with the guy on yesterday, we agreed exactly on one of the invoices for around $80K, but he was supposed to get me the other contract number and amount since there are supposedly two outstanding invoices.

This release of Columbia Gulf FTS-1 capacity has a term expiring on March 31, 2002. It is our understanding that Enron has not paid Columbia Gulf the November 2001 payment or the December 2001 payment. Since Enron has defaulted on its post petition payment and Columbia Gas of Ohio is ultimately responsible for payment to Columbia Gulf, pursuant to the Columbia Gulf tariff, Columbia Gas of Ohio has the right to recall the capacity upon 24 hours notice. Columbia Gas of Ohio hereby gives notice to Enron that unless payment is made to Columbia Gulf by 5:00 pm on Friday, February 1, 2002 by wire transfer, Columbia Gas of Ohio will recall the capacity effective Tuesday, February 5, 2002.

The details of the deal and my discussions with TW are given below. Please send him the wiring instructions so that we can get the money in the door. Please note that there will also be payments made to ENA under K#24924 for February and March 2002. The good news is that invoice credits will be very clear for Feruary and March, since the deals were done for the entire month. Richard Hanagriff's phone number is 713-853-6709. Thanks, Ruth CAPACITY RELEASE REVENUE SHARING TRANSACTION ENA and Transwestern agreed to share the revenues generated in releasing ENA's TW capacity in excess of our discounted rates on a month-to-month basis. The agreement also requires that TW release us from claims if the capacity is released at rates below ENA's contract rates. As a result, only K# 24924 (i.e. the San Juan contract) has been released to a third party. Transwestern was able to release the 25,000 Dth/d of Ignacio to I/B Link capacity at $0.065/Dth for January 11-31 (i.e. 21 days). Since our discounted rate is $0.06/Dth, ENA should receive 50% of $0.005/Dth, or $0.0025/Dth, for the 21 day period. Transwestern's invoice for January 2002 business showed that a $13,687.50 payment is due Transwestern. This amount was calculated from a credit of $0.0625/Dth for 21 days offsetting the $46,500 monthly charge. Another way to calculate this amount is that ENA's portion of the capacity release revenue sharing, $1,312.50, was netted against the $15,000.00 pipeline charges for January 1-10. ENA's position is that the agreement entitled ENA to receive the revenue sharing of $1,312.50 as a cash payment during the normal billing cycle, and that the other $15,000 should be addressed during the bankruptcy claim process. I discussed this issue with Paul Y'Barbo at Transwestern on February 15th. He followed up with me on February 20th that ENA will be paid the $1,312.50 as soon as Transwestern receives payment from the outside party that picked up ENA's capacity. TW thought that payment from the third party would be received in a ""couple of days"".",3624,"I can do it but I need to see the invoices in questions. Lee Ann, should we be updating Sitara with this info or do we just need to tell you?

Our Unify noms are non-pathed. 1) Can you look at the National Fuel invoice and verify that the accounting area will still work effortlessly if we change Unify to pathed. 2) If we elect to change Unify's model type to pathed, let's do it just like we did Southern Natural. And, I would like this done for May 1 noms in production and have the Scheduler (Beverly?) path in this new model type manner. We are suppose to be getting scheduled quantities in production starting tomorrow, unless ECOM prevents it, so you'll be able to see what the pipe expects in the pathed model type. 3) If we elect to NOT change Unify's model type to pathed, I guess we can't ever edi this pipe unless I can figure out some clever way to join up the noms. Beverly, Do you think it would be a problem to start entering the upstream k's and downstream k's when you path in Unify. The pipe told me this is mandatory data unless the nom is involved in the Appalachian area. If it is a problem, don't do, I don't want to slow you down since you have to enter the data twice today.

Originally they wanted to do this via IT request which I thought would cause some problems. Since then they changed their minds and decided to so it Sonat style and merely create a different service type (so as not to change historically). To my recollection that is the way that they were going and supposedly it was cleared with Connie Sutton. So this reversal does somewhat surprise me.

Our Unify noms are non-pathed. 1) Can you look at the National Fuel invoice and verify that the accounting area will still work effortlessly if we change Unify to pathed. 2) If we elect to change Unify's model type to pathed, let's do it just like we did Southern Natural. And, I would like this done for May 1 noms in production and have the Scheduler (Beverly?) path in this new model type manner. We are suppose to be getting scheduled quantities in production starting tomorrow, unless ECOM prevents it, so you'll be able to see what the pipe expects in the pathed model type. 3) If we elect to NOT change Unify's model type to pathed, I guess we can't ever edi this pipe unless I can figure out some clever way to join up the noms. Beverly, Do you think it would be a problem to start entering the upstream k's and downstream k's when you path in Unify. The pipe told me this is mandatory data unless the nom is involved in the Appalachian area. If it is a problem, don't do, I don't want to slow you down since you have to enter the data twice today. If and when we do edi, we'll need the up/down k's entered at that time.

John, can you fill in the missing details?

This is the purchase from Belden & Blake behind NYSEG. I changed the volume on deal 226563 from 1 dth/day to 1500 dth/day. This is the purchase from StatOil at CPA. The price on this deal is NX1 + .434 and the price on John's worksheet is NX1 + .54 (per MCF). John, is this price adjusted for dth?? I created deal 280185, purchase from StatOil, volume of 333 day, the price is NX1+ $.56 PER MCF. This is a purchase of local production behind the citygate. David, this deal probably needs to be hedged in Sitara. Cindy - deal 226563 is a purchase from CES - Statoil Energy. I set up deal 280185 with the same counterparty. This deal should have been in the system effective 1/1/2000. According to Elizabeth, we should not use the CES - StatOil Energy. It doesn't matter to me how its set up, however, this deal should have been in the system from Jan and it is the same type of deal as deal 226563. I changed the volume on deal 226747 from 1 dth to 1100 dth/day. This is a purchase from Questar and it is also local production behind CPA. John, there are 3 deals for Questar, the other 2 deals have volumes of 0 right now. Can you tell me how the volume should be split out for pricing purposes? Molly, I created deal 280132, FOM priced sale to CES. This deal will be matched with the CPA local production deals. Let me know if anyone has any questions.

I'm sure I left someone out. This is citygate gas ENA will sell to CES for June. This will reduce the numbers on the sheet Doug sent us yesterday. East Ohio Gas on CNG 10,000 dth/ month from Power Gas Marketing CPA on TCO 500 dth/day from Power Gas Marketing 1,833 dth/day from StatOil 1,100 dth/day from Questa - Note: this is an estimated volume. We should know the actual volume in the next day or so. Note: CES is not taking any Carnagie gas at CPA. National Fuel 250 dth/day from Belden & Blake. The deal expires 6/30/2000. Equitrans All of the Equitrans is production or pool gas on the pipeline. ENA nominates this gas. CES still has a citygate load of 1,280 dth/day for June on Equitrans so the production gas will be delivered to CES. CES will not be receiving any local production behind Peoples or NYSEG."
