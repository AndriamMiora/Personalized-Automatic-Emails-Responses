ENA is very interested in this topic. I was talking with Mona last week about my view that a strategy with PG&E should be supportive, not adversarial. ENA is extremely interested in a gas management position with PG&E and they have made it clear to us that our public positions against them are a significant commercial issue. I will spend some time with Portland and SF to get an ENA consensus on these points.

If you are not aware, PG&E is pushing for immediate end of their retail rate cap (so they can collect wholesale energy costs). EES is considering its positions in that matter to prepare for CPUC and legislative proceedings. I want to make sure that you are aware of these internal discussions. Key from EPMI include (1) endorse Cal ISO report conclusions, (2) competititve default supplier, (3) increasing rate freeze for all customers, and (4) transfer of PG&E Hydro to affiliate at $2.8B (to offset current undercollection). Please let me know if these positions make sense to you. While I think that our general position is retail volatility, given the current situation in SDG&E that is simply impossible politically.

Get CTC roll-off no earlier than Spring '01. Retroactive roll-off would be devastating. Use PG&E $15 billion exposure as leverage to get competitive default supplier in place (get them out of merchant supply). Impose a stair-step shape on the rate increase, to prompt customer migration. Keep PG&E somewhat at risk for wholesale cost recovery, delay recovery of under-recoveries until out years. Keep rate freeze (which is preferable to rate cap) to as short a period as possible, post '01. Here is a rework of Jim's bullet points to incorporate these thoughts: Keep in mind the numbers are all just placeholders and are not meant to be definitive. Once we start to hone in on the concept, we can develop the right numbers. From a retail perspective, this blends protection of the book with advancement of new market opportunity.
